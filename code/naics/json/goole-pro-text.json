        "text": "Android Auto is a mobile app developed by Google to mirror features from an Android device, such as a smartphone, to a car's compatible in-dash information and entertainment head unit.Once an Android device is paired with the head unit, the system mirrors qualified apps from the device to the vehicle's display, with a simple, driver-friendly user interface. Supported apps include GPS mapping/navigation, music playback, SMS, telephone, and web search. The system supports both touchscreen and button-controlled head unit displays, although hands-free operation through voice commands is encouraged to minimize driving distraction.Android Auto is part of the Open Automotive Alliance that was announced on June 25, 2014, and is a joint effort between 28 automobile manufacturers, with Nvidia as tech supplier. It is available in 36 countries.The most common way Android Auto is deployed is via an Android mobile device running the Android Auto app, acting as a master to a vehicle's dashboard head unit that supports this functionality.[1] Once the user's Android device is connected to the vehicle, the head unit will serve as an external display for the Android device, presenting supported software in a car-specific user interface provided by the Android Auto app.[1][2] In Android Auto's first iterations, the device was required to be connected via USB to the car.[3]Alternatively, in November 2016, Google added the option to run Android Auto as a regular app on an Android device, i.e., not tethered to a car's head unit, which allows it to be used on Android-powered head units, or simply on a personal phone or tablet in the vehicle.[4] In addition, on January 1, 2018, it was announced that JVCKenwood would be exhibiting wireless Android Auto-enabled head units at CES 2018, which would be capable of operating without the need for a wired connection.[5]As of May 2019, Android Auto is available in 36 countries.[6] The availability of apps on the system varies.An Android Auto SDK has been released, allowing third parties to modify their apps to work with Android Auto;[2] initially, only APIs for music and messaging apps would be available,[10][11] but it is expected that through Android Auto, the mobile device will have access to several of the automobile's sensors and inputs, such as GPS and high-quality GPS antennas, steering-wheel mounted buttons, the sound system, directional speakers, directional microphones, wheel speed, compass, mobile antennas, etc. Also, there is partial access to car data, a feature still under development.[12]At CES 2018, Google confirmed that the Google Assistant would be coming to Android Auto later in the year.[13]Currently supported apps include Google Maps and Waze, popular music players such as Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music and Spotify; and messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Skype and Telegram.In May 2015, Hyundai became the first manufacturer to offer Android Auto support, making it available first in the 2015 Hyundai Sonata.[14] Automobile manufacturers that will offer Android Auto support in their cars include Abarth, Acura, Alfa Romeo, Audi, Bentley, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Ford, GMC, Genesis, Holden[15], Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jaguar Land Rover, Jeep, Kia, Lamborghini, Lexus, Lincoln, Mahindra and Mahindra, Maserati, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, Peugeot, RAM, Renault, SEAT, Å koda, SsangYong, Subaru, Suzuki, Tata Motors Cars, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.[16]Additionally, aftermarket car-audio systems supporting Android Auto add the technology into host vehicles, including Pioneer,[17] Kenwood,[18] Panasonic,[19] and Sony.[20][21]In May 2019, Italy filed an antitrust complaint targeting Android Auto, citing that a Google policy of only allowing third-party media and messaging apps on the platform prevented Enel from offering an app for locating vehicle charging stations.[22]"

        "name": "Android OS",
        "text": "Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance, with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google.[10]Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008. The current stable version is Android 10, released on September 3, 2019. The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is primarily licensed under the Apache License. This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics, such as game consoles, digital cameras, PCs and others, each with a specialized user interface. Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables, both developed by Google.Android's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems, most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of proprietary software called Google Mobile Services (GMS),[11] that frequently comes pre-installed on said devices. This includes core apps such as Gmail, the digital distribution platform Google Play and associated Google Play Services development platform, and usually apps such as the Google Chrome web browser. These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google. Other competing Android ecosystems include Amazon.com's Fire OS, or LineageOS. Software distribution is generally offered through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy Store, or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid, which utilize software packages in the APK format.Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. As of May 2017, it has over two billion monthly active users, the largest installed base of any operating system, and as of December 2018, the Google Play Store features over 2.6 million apps.[12]Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White.[13][14] Rubin described the Android project as \"tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences\".[14] The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004.[15] The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals, and by five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile.[15][16]Rubin had difficulty attracting investors early on, and Android was facing eviction from its office space. Steve Perlman, a close friend of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope, and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding. Perlman refused a stake in the company, and has stated \"I did it because I believed in the thing, and I wanted to help Andy.\"[17][18]In July 2005,[14] Google acquired Android Inc. for at least $50 million.[19] Its key employees, including Rubin, Miner and White, joined Google as part of the acquisition.[14] Not much was known about the secretive Android at the time, with the company having provided few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones.[14] At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system.[20] Google had \"lined up a series of hardware components and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation\".[attribution needed][21]Speculation about Google's intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006.[22] An early prototype had a close resemblance to a BlackBerry phone, with no touchscreen and a physical QWERTY keyboard, but the arrival of 2007's Apple iPhone meant that Android \"had to go back to the drawing board\".[23][24] Google later changed its Android specification documents to state that \"Touchscreens will be supported\", although \"the Product was designed with the presence of discrete physical buttons as an assumption, therefore a touchscreen cannot completely replace physical buttons\".[25] By 2008, both Nokia and BlackBerry announced touch-based smartphones to rival the iPhone 3G, and Android's focus eventually switched to just touchscreens. The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream, also known as T-Mobile G1, announced on September 23, 2008.[26][27]On November 5, 2007, the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of technology companies including Google, device manufacturers such as HTC, Motorola and Samsung, wireless carriers such as Sprint and T-Mobile, and chipset makers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, unveiled itself, with a goal to develop \"the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices\".[28][29][30] Within a year, the Open Handset Alliance faced two other open source competitors, the Symbian Foundation and the LiMo Foundation, the latter also developing a Linux-based mobile operating system like Google. In September 2007, InformationWeek covered an Evalueserve study reporting that Google had filed several patent applications in the area of mobile telephony.[31][32]Since 2008, Android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system, adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat, with the first few Android versions being called \"Cupcake\", \"Donut\", \"Eclair\", and \"Froyo\", in that order. During its announcement of Android KitKat in 2013, Google explained that \"Since these devices make our lives so sweet, each Android version is named after a dessert\", although a Google spokesperson told CNN in an interview that \"It's kind of like an internal team thing, and we prefer to be a little bit â how should I say â a bit inscrutable in the matter, I'll say\".[33]In 2010, Google launched its Nexus series of devices, a lineup in which Google partnered with different device manufacturers to produce new devices and introduce new Android versions. The series was described as having \"played a pivotal role in Android's history by introducing new software iterations and hardware standards across the board\", and became known for its \"bloat-free\" software with \"timely ... updates\".[34] At its developer conference in May 2013, Google announced a special version of the Samsung Galaxy S4, where, instead of using Samsung's own Android customization, the phone ran \"stock Android\" and was promised to receive new system updates fast.[35] The device would become the start of the Google Play edition program, and was followed by other devices, including the HTC One Google Play edition,[36] and Moto G Google Play edition.[37] In 2015, Ars Technica wrote that \"Earlier this week, the last of the Google Play edition Android phones in Google's online storefront were listed as \"no longer available for sale\" and that \"Now they're all gone, and it looks a whole lot like the program has wrapped up\".[38][39]From 2008 to 2013, Hugo Barra served as product spokesperson, representing Android at press conferences and Google I/O, Google's annual developer-focused conference. He left Google in August 2013 to join Chinese phone maker Xiaomi.[40][41] Less than six months earlier, Google's then-CEO Larry Page announced in a blog post that Andy Rubin had moved from the Android division to take on new projects at Google, and that Sundar Pichai would become the new Android lead.[42][43] Pichai himself would eventually switch positions, becoming the new CEO of Google in August 2015 following the company's restructure into the Alphabet conglomerate,[44][45] making Hiroshi Lockheimer the new head of Android.[46][47]In June 2014, Google announced Android One, a set of \"hardware reference models\" that would \"allow [device makers] to easily create high-quality phones at low costs\", designed for consumers in developing countries.[48][49][50] In September, Google announced the first set of Android One phones for release in India.[51][52] However, Recode reported in June 2015 that the project was \"a disappointment\", citing \"reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners\" and \"misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked hardware\".[53] Plans to relaunch Android One surfaced in August 2015,[54] with Africa announced as the next location for the program a week later.[55][56] A report from The Information in January 2017 stated that Google is expanding its low-cost Android One program into the United States, although The Verge notes that the company will presumably not produce the actual devices itself.[57][58]Google introduced the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in October 2016, marketed as being the first phones made by Google,[59][60] and exclusively featured certain software features, such as the Google Assistant, before wider rollout.[61][62] The Pixel phones replaced the Nexus series,[63] with a new generation of Pixel phones launched in October 2017.[64]In May 2019, the operating system became entangled in the trade war between China and the United States involving Huawei which like many other tech firms have become dependent on access to the Android platform.[65][66] In the summer of 2019, Huawei announced it would create an alternative operating system to Android[67][68] known as Harmony OS,[69] and have filed for intellectual property rights across major global markets.[70][71] Huawei does not currently have any plans to replace Android in the near future, as Harmony OS is designed for internet of things devices, rather than for smartphones.[72]On August 22, 2019, it was announced that Android \"Q\" would officially be branded as Android 10, ending the historic practice of naming major versions after desserts. Google stated that these names were not \"inclusive\" to international users (due either to the aforementioned foods not being internationally known, or being difficult to pronounce in some languages).[73][74] On the same day, Android Police reported that Google had commissioned a statue of a giant number \"10\" to be installed in the lobby of the developers' new office.[75] Android 10 is scheduled to be released on September 3, 2019 to Google Pixel phones first.[76]Android's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard.[77] Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB.[78][79] The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented,[80] or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel.[81]Android devices boot to the homescreen, the primary navigation and information \"hub\" on Android devices, analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. Android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as a weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the homescreen.[82] A homescreen may be made up of several pages, between which the user can swipe back and forth.[83] Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the homescreen,[84] and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone.[85] Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors.[86]Along the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity. This status bar can be \"pulled\" down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates.[83] Notifications are \"short, timely, and relevant information about your app when it's not in use\", and when tapped, users are directed to a screen inside the app relating to the notification.[87] Beginning with Android 4.1 \"Jelly Bean\", \"expandable notifications\" allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification.[88]An All Apps screen lists all installed applications, with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen. A Recents screen lets users switch between recently used apps.[83]Applications (\"apps\"), which extend the functionality of devices, are written using the Android software development kit (SDK)[89] and, often, the Java programming language.[90] Java may be combined with C/C++,[91] together with a choice of non-default runtimes that allow better C++ support.[92] The Go programming language is also supported, although with a limited set of application programming interfaces (API).[93] In May 2017, Google announced support for Android app development in the Kotlin programming language.[94][95]The SDK includes a comprehensive set of development tools,[96] including a debugger, software libraries, a handset emulator based on QEMU, documentation, sample code, and tutorials. Initially, Google's supported integrated development environment (IDE) was Eclipse using the Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin; in December 2014, Google released Android Studio, based on IntelliJ IDEA, as its primary IDE for Android application development. Other development tools are available, including a native development kit (NDK) for applications or extensions in C or C++, Google App Inventor, a visual environment for novice programmers, and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks. In January 2014, Google unveiled an framework based on Apache Cordova for porting Chrome HTML 5 web applications to Android, wrapped in a native application shell.[97]Android has a growing selection of third-party applications, which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the application's APK (Android application package) file, or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install, update, and remove applications from their devices. Google Play Store is the primary application store installed on Android devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements and license the Google Mobile Services software.[98][99] Google Play Store allows users to browse, download and update applications published by Google and third-party developers; as of July 2013, there are more than one million applications available for Android in Play Store.[100] As of July 2013, 50 billion applications have been installed.[101][102] Some carriers offer direct carrier billing for Google Play application purchases, where the cost of the application is added to the user's monthly bill.[103] As of May 2017, there are over one billion active users a month for Gmail, Android, Chrome, Google Play and Maps.Due to the open nature of Android, a number of third-party application marketplaces also exist for Android, either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with Google Play Store, provide applications that cannot be offered on Google Play Store due to policy violations, or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have included the Amazon Appstore, GetJar, and SlideMe. F-Droid, another alternative marketplace, seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses.[98][104][105][106]Since Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU resources.[107][108] Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting with those that have been inactive for the longest amount of time.[109][110] Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task killer applications were doing more harm than good.[111]The main hardware platform for Android is ARM (the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86 and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android.[112][113][114][115] The unofficial Android-x86 project provided support for x86 architectures ahead of the official support.[116][117] The ARMv5TE and MIPS32/64 architectures were also historically supported but removed in later Android releases.[118] Since 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones[119] and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64. Since Android 5.0 \"Lollipop\", 64-bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the 32-bit variants.[112]Requirements for the minimum amount of RAM for devices running Android 7.1 range from in practice 2 GB for best hardware, down to 1 GB for the most common screen, to absolute minimum 512 MB for the lowest spec 32-bit smartphone. The recommendation for Android 4.4 is to have at least 512 MB of RAM,[120] while for \"low RAM\" devices 340 MB is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor.[121] Android 4.4 requires a 32-bit ARMv7, MIPS or x86 architecture processor (latter two through unofficial ports),[116][117] together with an OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible graphics processing unit (GPU).[122] Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and as of latest major version, 3.2 and since Android 7.0 Vulkan (and version 1.1 available for some devices[123]). Some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES, and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications.[122]Android devices incorporate many optional hardware components, including still or video cameras, GPS, orientation sensors, dedicated gaming controls, accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, magnetometers, proximity sensors, pressure sensors, thermometers, and touchscreens. Some hardware components are not required, but became standard in certain classes of devices, such as smartphones, and additional requirements apply if they are present. Some other hardware was initially required, but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether. For example, as Android was developed initially as a phone OS, hardware such as microphones were required, while over time the phone function became optional.[102] Android used to require an autofocus camera, which was relaxed to a fixed-focus camera[102] if present at all, since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when Android started to be used on set-top boxes.In addition to running on smartphones and tablets, several vendors run Android natively on regular PC hardware with a keyboard and mouse.[124][125][126][127] In addition to their availability on commercially available hardware, similar PC hardware-friendly versions of Android are freely available from the Android-x86 project, including customized Android 4.4.[128] Using the Android emulator that is part of the Android SDK, or third-party emulators, Android can also run non-natively on x86 architectures.[129][130] Chinese companies are building a PC and mobile operating system, based on Android, to \"compete directly with Microsoft Windows and Google Android\".[131] The Chinese Academy of Engineering noted that \"more than a dozen\" companies were customising Android following a Chinese ban on the use of Windows 8 on government PCs.[132][133][134]Android is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released, at which point the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP),[135] an open source initiative led by Google.[136] The AOSP code can be found without modification on select devices, mainly the Google Nexus and Google Pixel series of devices.[137] The source code is, in turn, customized by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to run on their hardware.[138][139] Android's source code does not contain the device drivers, often proprietary, that are needed for certain hardware components.[140] As a result most Android devices, including Google's own, ship with a combination of free and open source and proprietary software, with the software required for accessing Google services falling into the latter category.Google announces major incremental upgrades to Android on a yearly basis.[141] The updates can be installed on devices over-the-air.[142] The latest major release is Android 10.The extensive variation of hardware[143] in Android devices has caused significant delays for software upgrades and security patches. Each upgrade has had to be specifically tailored, a time- and resource-consuming process.[144] Except for devices within the Google Nexus and Pixel brands, updates have often arrived months after the release of the new version, or not at all.[145] Manufacturers often prioritize their newest devices and leave old ones behind.[146] Additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers who, after receiving updates from manufacturers, further customize Android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending out the upgrade.[146][147] There are also situations in which upgrades are impossible due to a manufacturer not updating necessary drivers.[148]The lack of after-sale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized by consumer groups and the technology media.[149][150][151] Some commentators have noted that the industry has a financial incentive not to upgrade their devices, as the lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of newer ones,[152] an attitude described as \"insulting\".[151] The Guardian complained that the method of distribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and carriers have designed it that way.[151] In 2011, Google partnered with a number of industry players to announce an \"Android Update Alliance\", pledging to deliver timely updates for every device for 18 months after its release; however, there has not been another official word about that alliance since its announcement.[146][153]In 2012, Google began de-coupling certain aspects of the operating system (particularly its central applications) so they could be updated through the Google Play store independently of the OS. One of those components, Google Play Services, is a closed-source system-level process providing APIs for Google services, installed automatically on nearly all devices running Android 2.2 \"Froyo\" and higher. With these changes, Google can add new system functions and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself.[154] As a result, Android 4.2 and 4.3 \"Jelly Bean\" contained relatively fewer user-facing changes, focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements.[155]HTC's then-executive Jason Mackenzie called monthly security updates \"unrealistic\" in 2015, and Google was trying to persuade carriers to exclude security patches from the full testing procedures. In May 2016, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that Google was making efforts to keep Android more up-to-date, including accelerated rates of security updates, rolling out technological workarounds, reducing requirements for phone testing, and ranking phone makers in an attempt to \"shame\" them into better behavior. As stated by Bloomberg: \"As smartphones get more capable, complex and hackable, having the latest software work closely with the hardware is increasingly important\". Hiroshi Lockheimer, the Android lead, admitted that \"It's not an ideal situation\", further commenting that the lack of updates is \"the weakest link on security on Android\". Wireless carriers were described in the report as the \"most challenging discussions\", due to their slow approval time while testing on their networks, despite some carriers, including Verizon Wireless and Sprint Corporation, already shortening their approval times. In a further effort for persuasion, Google shared a list of top phone makers measured by updated devices with its Android partners, and is considering making the list public[when?]. Mike Chan, co-founder of phone maker Nextbit and former Android developer, said that \"The best way to solve this problem is a massive re-architecture of the operating system\", \"or Google could invest in training manufacturers and carriers 'to be good Android citizens'\".[156][157][158]In May 2017, with the announcement of Android 8.0, Google introduced Project Treble, a major re-architect of the Android OS framework designed to make it easier, faster, and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to newer versions of Android. Project Treble separates the vendor implementation (device-specific, lower-level software written by silicon manufacturers) from the Android OS framework via a new \"vendor interface\". In Android 7.0 and earlier, no formal vendor interface exists, so device makers must update large portions of the Android code to move a device to a newer version of the operating system. With Treble, the new stable vendor interface provides access to the hardware-specific parts of Android, enabling device makers to deliver new Android releases simply by updating the Android OS framework, \"without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers.\"[159]In September 2017, Google's Project Treble team revealed that, as part of their efforts to improve the security lifecycle of Android devices, Google had managed to get the Linux Foundation to agree to extend the support lifecycle of the Linux Long-Term Support (LTS) kernel branch from the 2 years that it has historically lasted to 6 years for future versions of the LTS kernel, starting with Linux kernel 4.4.[160]In May 2019, with the announcement of Android 10, Google introduced Project Mainline to simplify and expedite delivery of updates to the Android ecosystem. Project Mainline enables updates to core OS components through the Google Play Store. As a result, important security and performance improvements that previously needed to be part of full OS updates can be downloaded and installed as easily as an app update.[161]Android's kernel is based on the Linux kernel's long-term support (LTS) branches. As of 2018, Android targets versions 4.4, 4.9 or 4.14 of the Linux kernel.[162] The actual kernel depends on the individual device.[163]Android's variant of the Linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycle, such as the inclusion of components like device trees, ashmem, ION, and different out of memory (OOM) handling.[164][165] Certain features that Google contributed back to the Linux kernel, notably a power management feature called \"wakelocks\",[166] were initially rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they felt that Google did not show any intent to maintain its own code.[167][168] Google announced in April 2010 that they would hire two employees to work with the Linux kernel community,[169] but Greg Kroah-Hartman, the current Linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch, said in December 2010 that he was concerned that Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linux.[168] Google engineer Patrick Brady once stated in the company's developer conference that \"Android is not Linux\",[170] with Computerworld adding that \"Let me make it simple for you, without Linux, there is no Android\".[171] Ars Technica wrote that \"Although Android is built on top of the Linux kernel, the platform has very little in common with the conventional desktop Linux stack\".[170]In August 2011, Linus Torvalds said that \"eventually Android and Linux would come back to a common kernel, but it will probably not be for four to five years\".[172] In December 2011, Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the start of Android Mainlining Project, which aims to put some Android drivers, patches and features back into the Linux kernel, starting in Linux 3.3.[173] Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel, after many previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes: to memory (the traditional suspend that Android uses), and to disk (hibernate, as it is known on the desktop).[174] Google maintains a public code repository that contains their experimental work to re-base Android off the latest stable Linux versions.[175][176]The flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions, such as /system for the operating system itself, and /data for user data and application installations.[177] In contrast to desktop Linux distributions, Android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as /system are read-only. However, root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in Android, which is used frequently by the open-source community to enhance the capabilities of their devices,[178] but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware.[179]Android is a Linux distribution according to the Linux Foundation,[180] Google's open-source chief Chris DiBona,[181] and several journalists.[182][183] Others, such as Google engineer Patrick Brady, say that Android is not Linux in the traditional Unix-like Linux distribution sense; Android does not include the GNU C Library (it uses Bionic as an alternative C library) and some of other components typically found in Linux distributions.[184]With the release of Android Oreo in 2017, Google began to require that devices shipped with new SoCs had Linux kernel version 4.4 or newer, for security reasons. Existing devices upgraded to Oreo, and new products launched with older SoCs, were exempt from this rule.[185][186]On top of the Linux kernel, there are the middleware, libraries and APIs written in C, and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries. Development of the Linux kernel continues independently of Android's other source code projects.Android uses Android Runtime (ART) as its runtime environment (introduced in version 4.4), which uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application. In Android 4.4, ART was an experimental feature and not enabled by default; it became the only runtime option in the next major version of Android, 5.0.[187] In versions no longer supported, until version 5.0 when ART took over, Android previously used Dalvik as a process virtual machine with trace-based just-in-time (JIT) compilation to run Dalvik \"dex-code\" (Dalvik Executable), which is usually translated from the Java bytecode. Following the trace-based JIT principle, in addition to interpreting the majority of application code, Dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select frequently executed code segments (\"traces\") each time an application is launched.[188][189][190] For its Java library, the Android platform uses a subset of the now discontinued Apache Harmony project.[191] In December 2015, Google announced that the next version of Android would switch to a Java implementation based on the OpenJDK project.[192]Android's standard C library, Bionic, was developed by Google specifically for Android, as a derivation of the BSD's standard C library code. Bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the Linux kernel. The main benefits of using Bionic instead of the GNU C Library (glibc) or uClibc are its smaller runtime footprint, and optimization for low-frequency CPUs. At the same time, Bionic is licensed under the terms of the BSD licence, which Google finds more suitable for the Android's overall licensing model.[190]Aiming for a different licensing model, toward the end of 2012, Google switched the Bluetooth stack in Android from the GPL-licensed BlueZ to the Apache-licensed BlueDroid.[193]Android does not have a native X Window System by default, nor does it support the full set of standard GNU libraries. This made it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Android,[184] until version r5 of the Android Native Development Kit brought support for applications written completely in C or C++.[194] Libraries written in C may also be used in applications by injection of a small shim and usage of the JNI.[195]In current versions of Android, \"Toybox\", a collection of command-line utilities (mostly for use by apps, as Android doesn't provide a command-line interface by default), is used (since the release of Marshmallow) replacing a similar \"Toolbox\" collection found in previous Android versions.[196]Android has another operating system, Trusty OS, within it, as a part of \"Trusty\" \"software components supporting a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on mobile devices.\" \"Trusty and the Trusty API are subject to change. [..] Applications for the Trusty OS can be written in C/C++ (C++ support is limited), and they have access to a small C library. [..] All Trusty applications are single-threaded; multithreading in Trusty userspace currently is unsupported. [..] Third-party application development is not supported in\" the current version, and software running on the OS and processor for it, run the \"DRM framework for protected content. [..] There are many other uses for a TEE such as mobile payments, secure banking, full-disk encryption, multi-factor authentication, device reset protection, replay-protected persistent storage, wireless display (\"cast\") of protected content, secure PIN and fingerprint processing, and even malware detection.\"[197]Android's source code is released by Google under an open source license, and its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems.[198] These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, with a comparable level of quality;[199] provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates; or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems, such as the HP TouchPad. Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications not provided by the original vendor, such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device's processor.[200] CyanogenMod was the most widely used community firmware,[201] now discontinued and succeeded by LineageOS.[202]There are, as of August 2019, a handful of notable custom Android distributions (ROMs) of the latest Android version 9.0 Pie, which was released publicly in August 2018. See List of custom Android distributions.Historically, device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third-party firmware development. Manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this.[203] Moreover, modified firmware such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features, such as tethering, for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium. As a result, technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions are common in many devices. However, as community-developed software has grown more popular, and following a statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United States that permits the \"jailbreaking\" of mobile devices,[204] manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development, with some, including HTC,[203] Motorola,[205] Samsung[206][207] and Sony,[208] providing support and encouraging development. As a result of this, over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders, similar to Nexus series of phones, although usually requiring that users waive their devices' warranties to do so.[203] However, despite manufacturer acceptance, some carriers in the US still require that phones are locked down, frustrating developers and customers.[209]Internally, Android identifies each supported device by its device codename, a short string,[210] which may or may not be similar to the model name used in marketing the device. For example, the device codename of the Pixel smartphone is sailfish.The device codename is usually not visible to the end user, but is important for determining compatibility with modified Android versions. It is sometimes also mentioned in articles discussing a device, because it allows to distinguish different hardware variants of a device, even if the manufacturer offers them under the same name. The device codename is available to running applications under android.os.Build.DEVICE.[211]As part of the broader 2013 mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in September 2013 that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), respectively, have access to the user data on iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android devices. They are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes.[212] In January 2014, further reports revealed the intelligence agencies' capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the Internet by social networks and other popular applications such as Angry Birds, which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons. GCHQ has, according to The Guardian, a wiki-style guide of different apps and advertising networks, and the different data that can be siphoned from each.[213] Later that week, the Finnish Angry Birds developer Rovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations, and called upon the wider industry to do the same.[214]The documents revealed a further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept Google Maps searches and queries submitted from Android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk.[213] The NSA and GCHQ insist their activities are in compliance with all relevant domestic and international laws, although the Guardian stated \"the latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information, especially for those outside the US, who enjoy fewer privacy protections than Americans.\"[213]Leaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed Vault 7 and dated from 2013â2016, detail the capabilities of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare, including the ability to compromise the operating systems of most smartphones (including Android).[215][216]Research from security company Trend Micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware, where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium-rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user. Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device, or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties.[217] Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially; however, Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons,[218][219] and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users.[218] Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare,[219] and a survey conducted by F-Secure showed that only 0.5% of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store.[220]In August 2015, Google announced that devices in the Google Nexus series would begin to receive monthly security patches. Google also wrote that \"Nexus devices will continue to receive major updates for at least two years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the Google Store.\"[221][222][223] The following October, researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that 87.7% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support.[224][225][226] Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that \"Android was originally designed, above all else, to be widely adopted. Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share, so it was happy to give up control and give everyone a seat at the table in exchange for adoption. [...] Now, though, Android has around 75â80 percent of the worldwide smartphone marketâmaking it not just the world's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system, period. As such, security has become a big issue. Android still uses a software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update, and it just doesn't work\".[227] Following news of Google's monthly schedule, some manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, promised to issue monthly security updates,[228] but, as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016, \"instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models. And a bunch of broken promises\".[229]In a March 2017 post on Google's Security Blog, Android security leads Adrian Ludwig and Mel Miller wrote that \"More than 735 million devices from 200+ manufacturers received a platform security update in 2016\" and that \"Our carrier and hardware partners helped expand deployment of these updates, releasing updates for over half of the top 50 devices worldwide in the last quarter of 2016\". They also wrote that \"About half of devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received a platform security update in the previous year\", stating that their work would continue to focus on streamlining the security updates program for easier deployment by manufacturers.[230] Furthermore, in a comment to TechCrunch, Ludwig stated that the wait time for security updates had been reduced from \"six to nine weeks down to just a few days\", with 78% of flagship devices in North America being up-to-date on security at the end of 2016.[231]Patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-priced devices.[232][233] However, the open-source nature of Android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses. For example, Samsung has worked with General Dynamics through their Open Kernel Labs acquisition to rebuild Jelly Bean on top of their hardened microvisor for the \"Knox\" project.[234][235]Android smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points, encountered as phone users move around, to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing them to run apps like Foursquare, Google Latitude, Facebook Places, and to deliver location-based ads.[236] Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid,[237] an academic research-funded project, can, in some cases, detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers.[238]Android applications run in a sandbox, an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system's resources, unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed, however this may not be possible for pre-installed apps. It is not possible, for example, to turn off the microphone access of the pre-installed camera app without disabling the camera completely. This is valid also in Android versions 7 and 8.[239]Since February 2012, Google has used its Google Bouncer malware scanner to watch over and scan apps available in the Google Play store.[240][241] A \"Verify Apps\" feature was introduced in November 2012, as part of the Android 4.2 \"Jelly Bean\" operating system version, to scan all apps, both from Google Play and from third-party sources, for malicious behaviour.[242] Originally only doing so during installation, Verify Apps received an update in 2014 to \"constantly\" scan apps, and in 2017 the feature was made visible to users through a menu in Settings.[243][244]Before installing an application, the Google Play store displays a list of the requirements an app needs to function. After reviewing these permissions, the user can choose to accept or refuse them, installing the application only if they accept.[245] In Android 6.0 \"Marshmallow\", the permissions system was changed; apps are no longer automatically granted all of their specified permissions at installation time. An opt-in system is used instead, in which users are prompted to grant or deny individual permissions to an app when they are needed for the first time. Applications remember the grants, which can be revoked by the user at any time. Pre-installed apps, however, are not always part of this approach. In some cases it may not be possible to deny certain permissions to pre-installed apps, nor be possible to disable them. The Google Play Services app cannot be uninstalled, nor disabled. Any force stop attempt, result in the app restarting itself.[246][247] The new permissions model is used only by applications developed for Marshmallow using its software development kit (SDK), and older apps will continue to use the previous all-or-nothing approach. Permissions can still be revoked for those apps, though this might prevent them from working properly, and a warning is displayed to that effect.[248][249]In September 2014, Jason Nova of Android Authority reported on a study by the German security company Fraunhofer AISEC in antivirus software and malware threats on Android. Nova wrote that \"The Android operating system deals with software packages by sandboxing them; this does not allow applications to list the directory contents of other apps to keep the system safe. By not allowing the antivirus to list the directories of other apps after installation, applications that show no inherent suspicious behavior when downloaded are cleared as safe. If then later on parts of the app are activated that turn out to be malicious, the antivirus will have no way to know since it is inside the app and out of the antivirusâ jurisdiction\". The study by Fraunhofer AISEC, examining antivirus software from Avast, AVG, Bitdefender, ESET, F-Secure, Kaspersky, Lookout, McAfee (formerly Intel Security), Norton, Sophos, and Trend Micro, revealed that \"the tested antivirus apps do not provide protection against customized malware or targeted attacks\", and that \"the tested antivirus apps were also not able to detect malware which is completely unknown to date but does not make any efforts to hide its malignity\".[250]In August 2013, Google announced Android Device Manager (renamed Find My Device in May 2017),[251][252] a service that allows users to remotely track, locate, and wipe their Android device,[253][254] with an Android app for the service released in December.[255][256] In December 2016, Google introduced a Trusted Contacts app, letting users request location-tracking of loved ones during emergencies.[257][258]On October 8, 2018 Google announced new Google Play store requirements to combat over-sharing of potentially sensitive information, including call and text logs. The issue stems from the fact that many apps request permissions to access user's personal information (even if this information is not needed for the app to function) and some users unquestionably grant these permissions. Alternatively, a permission might be listed in the app manifest as required (as opposed to optional) and app would not install unless user grants the permission; user can withdraw any, even required, permission from any app in the device settings after app installation, but few users do this. Google promised to work with developers and create exceptions if their apps require Phone or SMS permissions for \"core app functionality\". The new policies enforcement started on January 6, 2019, 90 days after policy announcement on October 8, 2018. Furthermore, Google announced a new \"target API level requirement\" (targetSdkVersion in manifest) at least Android 8.0 (API level 26) for all new apps and app updates. The API level requirement might combat practice of app developers bypassing some permission screens by specifying early Android versions that had more coarse permission model.[259][260]The source code for Android is open-source: it is developed in private by Google, with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android is released. Google publishes most of the code (including network and telephony stacks) under the non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0. which allows modification and redistribution.[261][262] The license does not grant rights to the \"Android\" trademark, so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts. Associated Linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft GNU General Public License version 2, developed by the Open Handset Alliance, with the source code publicly available at all times. Typically, Google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device (part of the Nexus series) featuring the new version of Android, then makes the source code available after that device has been released.[263] The only Android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only 3.0 Honeycomb release. The reason, according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post, was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom,[264] and they did not want third parties creating a \"really bad user experience\" by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablets.[265]Only the base Android operating system (including some applications) is open-source software, whereas most Android devices ship with a substantial amount of proprietary software, such as Google Mobile Services, which includes applications such as Google Play Store, Google Search, and Google Play Services â a software layer that provides APIs for the integration with Google-provided services, among others. These applications must be licensed from Google by device makers, and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements.[99] Custom, certified distributions of Android produced by manufacturers (such as TouchWiz and HTC Sense) may also replace certain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock Android operating system.[98] There may also be \"binary blob\" drivers required for certain hardware components in the device.[98][140]Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have been critical of Android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as Replicant, because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary, and because the Google Play Store application can forcibly install or uninstall applications and, as a result, invite non-free software; although the Free Software Foundation has not found Google to use it for malicious reasons.[266][267]Google licenses their Google Mobile Services software, along with Android trademarks, only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google's compatibility standards specified in the Android Compatibility Program document.[268] Thus, forks of Android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of Google's non-free components, stay incompatible with applications that require them, and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store.[98] Examples of such Android forks are Amazon's Fire OS (which is used on the Kindle Fire line of tablets, and oriented toward Amazon services), the Nokia X Software Platform (a fork used by the Nokia X family, oriented primarily toward Nokia and Microsoft services), and other forks that exclude Google apps due to the general unavailability of Google services in certain regions (such as China).[269][270] In 2014, Google also began to require that all Android devices which license the Google Mobile Services software display a prominent \"Powered by Android\" logo on their boot screens.[99] Google has also enforced preferential bundling and placement of Google Mobile Services on devices, including mandated bundling of the entire main suite of Google applications, and that shortcuts to Google Search and the Play Store app must be present on or near the main home screen page in its default configuration.[271]Some stock applications and components in AOSP code that were formerly used by earlier versions of Android, such as Search, Music, Calendar, and the location API, were abandoned by Google in favor of non-free replacements distributed through Play Store (Google Search, Google Play Music, and Google Calendar) and Google Play Services, which are no longer open-source. Moreover, open-source variants of some applications also exclude functions that are present in their non-free versions, such as Photosphere panoramas in Camera, and a Google Now page on the default home screen (exclusive to the proprietary version \"Google Now Launcher\", whose code is embedded within that of the main Google application).[98][272][273][274] These measures are likely intended to discourage forks and encourage commercial licensing in line with Google requirements, as the majority of the operating system's core functionality (and in turn, third-party software), are dependent on proprietary components licensed exclusively by Google, and it would take significant development resources to develop an alternative suite of software and APIs to replicate or replace them. Apps that do not use Google components would also be at a functional disadvantage, as they can only use APIs contained within the OS itself.[275]In March 2018, it was reported that Google had begun to block \"uncertified\" Android devices from using Google Mobile Services software, and display a warning indicating that \"the device manufacturer has preloaded Google apps and services without certification from Google\". Users of custom ROMs are able to register their device ID to their Google account to remove this block.[276]Members of the Open Handset Alliance, which include the majority of Android OEMs, are also contractually forbidden from producing Android devices based on forks of the OS;[98][277] in 2012, Acer Inc. was forced by Google to halt production on a device powered by Alibaba Group's Aliyun OS with threats of removal from the OHA, as Google deemed the platform to be an incompatible version of Android. Alibaba Group defended the allegations, arguing that the OS was a distinct platform from Android (primarily using HTML5 apps), but incorporated portions of Android's platform to allow backwards compatibility with third-party Android software. Indeed, the devices did ship with an application store which offered Android apps; however, the majority of them were pirated.[278][279][280]Android includes a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that defines a standard interface for hardware vendors to implement, which enables Android to be agnostic about lower-level driver implementations[281].Android received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007. Although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance, it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with Android.[282] The idea of an open-source, Linux-based development platform sparked interest,[283] but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market, such as Nokia and Microsoft, and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development.[284] These established players were skeptical: Nokia was quoted as saying \"we don't see this as a threat,\" and a member of Microsoft's Windows Mobile team stated \"I don't understand the impact that they are going to have.\"[285]Since then Android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone operating system[286][287] and \"one of the fastest mobile experiences available\".[288] Reviewers have highlighted the open-source nature of the operating system as one of its defining strengths, allowing companies such as Nokia (Nokia X family),[289] Amazon (Kindle Fire), Barnes & Noble (Nook), Ouya, Baidu and others to fork the software and release hardware running their own customised version of Android. As a result, it has been described by technology website Ars Technica as \"practically the default operating system for launching new hardware\" for companies without their own mobile platforms.[286] This openness and flexibility is also present at the level of the end user: Android allows extensive customisation of devices by their owners and apps are freely available from non-Google app stores and third party websites. These have been cited as among the main advantages of Android phones over others.[286][290]Despite Android's popularity, including an activation rate three times that of iOS, there have been reports that Google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected.[291] The Verge suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services â Amazon's Kindle Fire line uses Fire OS, a heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google's proprietary components, and requires that users obtain software from its competing Amazon Appstore instead of Play Store.[98] In 2014, in an effort to improve prominence of the Android brand, Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an Android logo on the boot screen.[99]Android has suffered from \"fragmentation\",[292] a situation where the variety of Android devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them, makes the task of developing applications that work consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as iOS where hardware and software varies less. For example, according to data from OpenSignal in July 2013, there were 11,868 models of Android device, numerous different screen sizes and eight Android OS versions simultaneously in use, while the large majority of iOS users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that OS.[293] Critics such as Apple Insider have asserted that fragmentation via hardware and software pushed Android's growth through large volumes of low end, budget-priced devices running older versions of Android. They maintain this forces Android developers to write for the \"lowest common denominator\" to reach as many users as possible, who have too little incentive to make use of the latest hardware or software features only available on a smaller percentage of devices.[294] However, OpenSignal, who develops both Android and iOS apps, concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier, Android's wider global reach also increases the potential reward.[293]Research company Canalys estimated in the second quarter of 2009, that Android had a 2.8% share of worldwide smartphone shipments.[295] By May 2010, Android had a 10% worldwide smartphone market share, overtaking Windows Mobile,[296] whilst in the US Android held a 28% share, overtaking iPhone OS.[297] By the fourth quarter of 2010, its worldwide share had grown to 33% of the market becoming the top-selling smartphone platform,[298] overtaking Symbian.[299] In the US it became the top-selling platform in April 2011, overtaking BlackBerry OS with a 31.2% smartphone share, according to comScore.[300]By the third quarter of 2011, Gartner estimated that more than half (52.5%) of the smartphone sales belonged to Android.[301] By the third quarter of 2012 Android had a 75% share of the global smartphone market according to the research firm IDC.[302]In July 2011, Google said that 550,000 Android devices were being activated every day,[303] up from 400,000 per day in May,[304] and more than 100 million devices had been activated[305] with 4.4% growth per week.[303] In September 2012, 500 million devices had been activated with 1.3 million activations per day.[306][307] In May 2013, at Google I/O, Sundar Pichai announced that 900 million Android devices had been activated.[308]Android market share varies by location. In July 2012, \"mobile subscribers aged 13+\" in the United States using Android were up to 52%,[309] and rose to 90% in China.[310] During the third quarter of 2012, Android's worldwide smartphone shipment market share was 75%,[302] with 750 million devices activated in total. In April 2013 Android had 1.5 million activations per day.[307] As of May 2013, 48 billion applications (\"apps\") have been installed from the Google Play store,[311] and by September 2013, one billion Android devices have been activated.[312]As of February 2017, the Google Play store has over 2.7 million Android applications published,[313] and As of May 2016, apps have been downloaded more than 65 billion times.[314] The operating system's success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so-called \"smartphone wars\" between technology companies.[315][316]Android devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most markets, including the US, while \"only in Japan was Apple on top\" (SeptemberâNovember 2013 numbers).[317] At the end of 2013, over 1.5 billion Android smartphones have been sold in the four years since 2010,[318][319] making Android the most sold phone and tablet OS. Three billion Android smartphones are estimated to be sold by the end of 2014 (including previous years). According to Gartner research company, Android-based devices outsold all contenders, every year since 2012.[320] In 2013, it outsold Windows 2.8:1 or by 573 million.[321][322][323] As of 2015, Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems;[19] Since 2013, devices running it also sell more than Windows, iOS and Mac OS X devices combined.[324]According to StatCounter, which tracks only the use for browsing the web, Android is the most popular mobile operating system since August 2013.[325] Android is the most popular operating system for web browsing in India and several other countries (e.g. virtually all of Asia, with Japan and North Korea exceptions). According to StatCounter, Android is most used on mobile in all African countries, and it stated \"mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in several countries including India, South Africa and Saudi Arabia\",[326] with virtually all countries in Africa having done so already (except for seven countries, including Egypt), such as Ethiopia and Kenya in which mobile (including tablets) usage is at 90.46% (Android only, accounts for 75.81% of all use there).[327][328]While Android phones in the Western world commonly include Google's proprietary add-ons (such as Google Play) to the otherwise open-source operating system, this is increasingly not the case in emerging markets; \"ABI Research claims that 65 million devices shipped globally with open-source Android in the second quarter of [2014], up from 54 million in the first quarter\"; depending on country, percent of phones estimated to be based only on AOSP source code, forgoing the Android trademark: Thailand (44%), Philippines (38%), Indonesia (31%), India (21%), Malaysia (24%), Mexico (18%), Brazil (9%).[329]According to a January 2015 Gartner report, \"Android surpassed a billion shipments of devices in 2014, and will continue to grow at a double-digit pace in 2015, with a 26 percent increase year over year.\" This made it the first time that any general-purpose operating system has reached more than one billion end users within a year: by reaching close to 1.16 billion end users in 2014, Android shipped over four times more than iOS and OS X combined, and over three times more than Microsoft Windows. Gartner expected the whole mobile phone market to \"reach two billion units in 2016\", including Android.[330] Describing the statistics, Farhad Manjoo wrote in The New York Times that \"About one of every two computers sold today is running Android. [It] has become Earth's dominant computing platform.\"[19]According to a Statistica's estimate, Android smartphones had an installed base of 1.8 billion units in 2015, which was 76% of the estimated total number of smartphones worldwide.[331][332][a] Android has the largest installed base of any mobile operating system and, since 2013, the highest-selling operating system overall[321][324][334][335][336] with sales in 2012, 2013 and 2014[337] close to the installed base of all PCs.[338]In the second quarter of 2014, Android's share of the global smartphone shipment market was 84.7%, a new record.[339][340] This had grown to 87.5% worldwide market share by the third quarter of 2016,[341] leaving main competitor iOS with 12.1% market share.[342]According to an April 2017 StatCounter report, Android overtook Microsoft Windows to become the most popular operating system for total Internet usage.[343][344] It has maintained the plurality since then.[345]In September 2015, Google announced that Android had 1.4 billion monthly active users.[346][347] This changed to 2 billion monthly active users in May 2017.[348][349]Despite its success on smartphones, initially Android tablet adoption was slow.[350] One of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet applications, but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was a significant market for them.[351][352] The content and app \"ecosystem\" proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets. Due to the lack of Android tablet-specific applications in 2011, early Android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone applications that were ill-suited to larger screen sizes, whereas the dominance of Apple's iPad was reinforced by the large number of tablet-specific iOS applications.[352][353]Despite app support in its infancy, a considerable number of Android tablets, like the Barnes & Noble Nook (alongside those using other operating systems, such as the HP TouchPad and BlackBerry PlayBook) were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the iPad.[352] InfoWorld has suggested that some Android manufacturers initially treated their first tablets as a \"Frankenphone business\", a short-term low-investment opportunity by placing a smartphone-optimized Android OS (before Android 3.0 Honeycomb for tablets was available) on a device while neglecting user interface. This approach, such as with the Dell Streak, failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as damaging the early reputation of Android tablets.[354][355] Furthermore, several Android tablets such as the Motorola Xoom were priced the same or higher than the iPad, which hurt sales. An exception was the Amazon Kindle Fire, which relied upon lower pricing as well as access to Amazon's ecosystem of applications and content.[352][356]This began to change in 2012, with the release of the affordable Nexus 7 and a push by Google for developers to write better tablet applications.[357] According to International Data Corporation, shipments of Android-powered tablets surpassed iPads in Q3 2012.[358]As of the end of 2013, over 191.6 million Android tablets had sold in three years since 2011.[359][360] This made Android tablets the most-sold type of tablet in 2013, surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013.[361]According to StatCounter's web use statistics, as of August 15, 2017, Android tablets represent the majority of tablet devices used in South America (57.46%)[362] and Africa (69.08%),[363] while being a distant second to iOS in North America (25.29%) and Europe (32.64%), despite having sizeable majorities in many Central American, Caribbean, and Eastern European states.[364]) and representing the majority in Asia (51.25%)[365] notably in India (65.98%)[366] and Indonesia (82.18%).[367] Android is an extremely distant second at 11.93% in Oceania as well, mostly due to Australia (10.71%) and New Zealand (16.9%), while in some countries such as Nauru over 80% of tablets are believed to use Android.[368] As well, Android is more often than not used by the minority of web users in Antarctica, which has no permanent population.[369]In March 2016, Galen Gruman of InfoWorld stated that Android devices could be a \"real part of your business [..] there's no longer a reason to keep Android at arm's length. It can now be as integral to your mobile portfolio as Apple's iOS devices are\".[370] A year earlier, Gruman had stated that Microsoft's own mobile Office apps were \"better on iOS and Android\" than on Microsoft's own Windows 10 devices.[371]Android Pie 9.0 is by far the most used Android, at over 39%, well over twice as popular as the next most popular single version (Oreo 8.1).[372][373] Over 62% of devices run on Android 8.0 and later (all supported versions). On tablets only, Android Lollipop 5.1 is the single most used version at 20.95% (and most Android tablets use unsupported Android versions).[374] The most used versions of Android on tablets vary a lot by country, still Lollipop 5.1 is the most used single version in the United States (and e.g. India) at 39.83%, while a recent Oreo 8.1 is most used in e.g. China, Australia, all Nordic countries and many other European, and Egypt.[375] In Australia, Android Pie 9.0 is most popular at 18.83%.[376]As of May 2019, 78.9% of devices have OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher; 35.5% are on latest OpenGL ES 3.2. Note however Android also supports Vulkan, a successor to OpenGL.In general, paid Android applications can easily be pirated.[379] In a May 2012 interview with Eurogamer, the developers of Football Manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 9:1 for their game Football Manager Handheld.[380] However, not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue; for example, in July 2012 the developers of the game Wind-up Knight said that piracy levels of their game were only 12%, and most of the piracy came from China, where people cannot purchase apps from Google Play.[381]In 2010, Google released a tool for validating authorized purchases for use within apps, but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to crack. Google responded that the tool, especially its initial release, was intended as a sample framework for developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs, not as a finished piracy solution.[382] Android \"Jelly Bean\" introduced the ability for paid applications to be encrypted, so that they may work only on the device for which they were purchased.[383][384]The success of Android has made it a target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies, both Android and Android phone manufacturers having been involved in numerous patent lawsuits and other legal challenges.On August 12, 2010, Oracle sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming language.[385] Oracle originally sought damages up to $6.1 billion,[386] but this valuation was rejected by a United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate.[387] In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle's patents were invalid, and several other defenses. They said that Android's Java runtime environment is based on Apache Harmony, a clean room implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called Dalvik.[388] In May 2012, the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable.[389][390] The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code.[391] On May 9, 2014, the Federal Circuit partially reversed the district court ruling, ruling in Oracle's favor on the copyrightability issue, and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court.[392][393]In December 2015, Google announced that the next major release of Android (Android Nougat) would switch to OpenJDK, which is the official open-source implementation of the Java platform, instead of using the now-discontinued Apache Harmony project as its runtime. Code reflecting this change was also posted to the AOSP source repository.[191] In its announcement, Google claimed this was part of an effort to create a \"common code base\" between Java on Android and other platforms.[192] Google later admitted in a court filing that this was part of an effort to address the disputes with Oracle, as its use of OpenJDK code is governed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with a linking exception, and that \"any damages claim associated with the new versions expressly licensed by Oracle under OpenJDK would require a separate analysis of damages from earlier releases\".[191] In June 2016, a United States federal court ruled in favor of Google, stating that its use of the APIs was fair use.[394]In 2013, FairSearch, a lobbying organization supported by Microsoft, Oracle and others, filed a complaint regarding Android with the European Commission, alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted anti-competitive predatory pricing. The Free Software Foundation Europe, whose donors include Google, disputed the Fairsearch allegations.[395] On April 20, 2016, the EU filed a formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations, arguing that its leverage over Android vendors, including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software, hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android, and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android, constituted anti-competitive practices.[396] In August 2016, Google was fined US$6.75 million by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) under similar allegations by Yandex.[397] The European Commission issued its decision on July 18, 2018, determining that Google had conducted three antitrust operations related to Android: bundling Google's search and Chrome as part of Android, blocking phone manufacturers from using forked versions of Android, and establishing deals with phone manufacturers and network providers to exclusively bundle the Google search application on handsets (a practice Google ended by 2014). The EU fined Google for â¬4.3 billion (about US$5 billion) and required the company to end this conduct within 90 days.[398] Google filed its appeal of the ruling in October 2018, though will not ask for any interim measures to delay the onset of conduct requirements.[399]On October 16, 2018, Google announced that it would change its distribution model for Google Mobile Services in the EU, since part of its revenues streams for Android which came through use of Google Search and Chrome were now prohibited by the EU's ruling. While the core Android system remains free, OEMs in Europe would be required to purchase a paid license to the core suite of Google applications, such as Gmail, Google Maps and the Google Play Store. Google Search will be licensed separately, with an option to include Google Chrome at no additional cost atop Search. European OEMs are able to bundle third-party alternatives on phones and devices sold to customers, if they so choose. OEMs will no longer be barred from selling any device running incompatible versions of Android in Europe.[400]In addition to lawsuits against Google directly, various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices, with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market.[401] Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement, with Apple's ongoing legal action against Samsung being a particularly high-profile case. In January 2012, Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with eleven Android device manufacturers, whose products account for \"70 percent of all Android smartphones\" sold in the US[402] and 55% of the worldwide revenue for Android devices.[403] These include Samsung and HTC.[404] Samsung's patent settlement with Microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system.[401] Microsoft has also tied its own Android software to patent licenses, requiring the bundling of Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on Android devices to subsidize the licensing fees, while at the same time helping to promote its software lines.[405][406]Google has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape in the United States, accusing Apple, Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take down Android through patent litigation, rather than innovating and competing with better products and services.[407] In August 2011, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion, which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect Android, since Motorola Mobility held more than 17,000 patents.[408][409] In December 2011, Google bought over a thousand patents from IBM.[410]Google has developed several variations of Android for specific use cases, including Android Wear, later renamed Wear OS, for wearable devices such as wrist watches,[411][412] Android TV for televisions,[413][414] and Android Things for smart devices and Internet of things.[415][416] Additionally, by providing infrastructure that combines dedicated hardware and dedicated applications running on regular Android, Google have opened up the platform for its use in particular usage scenarios, such as Android Auto for cars,[417][418] and Daydream, a Virtual Reality platform.[419]The open and customizable nature of Android allows device makers to use it on other electronics as well, including laptops, netbooks,[420][421] and desktop computers,[422] cameras,[423] headphones,[424] home automation systems, game consoles,[425] media players,[426] satellites,[427] routers,[428] printers,[429] payment terminals,[430] automated teller machines,[431] and robots.[432] Additionally, Android has been installed and run on a variety of less-technical objects, including calculators,[433] single-board computers,[434] feature phones,[435] electronic dictionaries,[436] alarm clocks,[437] refrigerators,[438] landline telephones,[439] coffee machines,[440] bicycles,[441] and mirrors.[425]Ouya, a video game console running Android, became one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns, crowdfunding US$8.5m for its development,[442][443] and was later followed by other Android-based consoles, such as Nvidia's Shield Portable â an Android device in a video game controller form factor.[444]In 2011, Google demonstrated \"Android@Home\", a home automation technology which uses Android to control a range of household devices including light switches, power sockets and thermostats.[445] Prototype light bulbs were announced that could be controlled from an Android phone or tablet, but Android head Andy Rubin was cautious to note that \"turning a lightbulb on and off is nothing new\", pointing to numerous failed home automation services. Google, he said, was thinking more ambitiously and the intention was to use their position as a cloud services provider to bring Google products into customers' homes.[446][447]Parrot unveiled an Android-based car stereo system known as Asteroid in 2011,[448] followed by a successor, the touchscreen-based Asteroid Smart, in 2012.[449] In 2013, Clarion released its own Android-based car stereo, the AX1.[450] In January 2014, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Google announced the formation of the Open Automotive Alliance, a group including several major automobile makers (Audi, General Motors, Hyundai, and Honda) and Nvidia, which aims to produce Android-based in-car entertainment systems for automobiles, \"[bringing] the best of Android into the automobile in a safe and seamless way.\"[451]Android comes preinstalled on a few laptops (a similar functionality of running Android applications is also available in Google's Chrome OS) and can also be installed on personal computers by end users.[452] On those platforms Android provides additional functionality for physical keyboards[453] and mice, together with the \"Alt-Tab\" key combination for switching applications quickly with a keyboard. In December 2014, one reviewer commented that Android's notification system is \"vastly more complete and robust than in most environments\" and that Android is \"absolutely usable\" as one's primary desktop operating system.[454]In October 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that Android will serve as Google's future main laptop operating system, with the plan to fold Chrome OS into it by 2017.[455][456] Google's Sundar Pichai, who led the development of Android, explained that \"mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today.\"[455] Also, back in 2009, Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself said that Chrome OS and Android would \"likely converge over time.\"[457] Lockheimer, who replaced Pichai as head of Android and Chrome OS, responded to this claim with an official Google blog post stating that \"While we've been working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems, there's no plan to phase out Chrome OS [which has] guaranteed auto-updates for five years\".[458] That is unlike Android where support is shorter with \"EOL dates [being..] at least 3 years [into the future] for Android tablets for education\".[459]At Google I/O in May 2016, Google announced Daydream, a virtual reality platform that relies on a smartphone and provides VR capabilities through a virtual reality headset and controller designed by Google itself.[419] The platform is built into Android starting with Android Nougat, differentiating from standalone support for VR capabilities. The software is available for developers, and was released in 2016.The mascot of Android is a green android robot, as related to the software's name. Although it has no official name, the Android team at Google reportedly call it \"Bugdroid\".[460] Due to Android's high popularity in the 2010s, it has become one of the most recognizable icons in the technology world.[citation needed]It was designed by then-Google graphic designer Irina Blok on November 5, 2007 when Android was announced. Contrary to reports that she was tasked with a project to create an icon,[461] Blok confirmed in an interview that she independently developed it and made it open source. The robot design was initially not presented to Google, but it quickly became commonplace in the Android development team, with various different variations of it created by the developers there who liked the figure, as it was free under a Creative Commons license.[462][463] Its popularity amongst the development team eventually led to Google adopting it as an official icon as part of the Android logo when it launched to consumers in 2008."

        "name": "Calendar",
        "text": "Google Calendar is a time-management and scheduling calendar service developed by Google. It became available in beta release April 13, 2006, and in general release in July 2009, on the web and as mobile apps for the Android and iOS platforms.Google Calendar allows users to create and edit events. Reminders can be enabled for events, with options available for type and time. Event locations can also be added, and other users can be invited to events. Users can enable or disable the visibility of special calendars, including Birthdays, where the app retrieves dates of births from Google contacts and displays birthday cards on a yearly basis, and Holidays, a country-specific calendar that displays dates of special occasions. Over time, Google has added functionality that makes use of machine learning, including \"Events from Gmail\", where event information from a user's Gmail messages are automatically added to Google Calendar; \"Reminders\", where users add to-do activities that can be automatically updated with new information; \"Smart Suggestions\", where the app recommends titles, contacts, and locations when creating events; and \"Goals\", where users enter information on a specified personal goal, and the app automatically schedules the activity at optimal times.Google Calendar's mobile apps have received polarized reviews. [3]2015 reviews of the Android and iOS apps both praised and criticized the design. While some critics praised the design for being \"cleaner\", \"bold\" and making use of \"colorful graphics\", other reviewers asserted that the graphics took up too much space. The Smart Suggestions feature was also liked and disliked, with varying levels of success in the app actually managing to suggest relevant information upon event creation. The integration between Google Calendar and Gmail was praised, however, with critics writing that \"all of the relevant details are there\".Google Calendar allows users to create and edit events. Events have a set start time and stop time, with an option for an \"All-day event\". Users can enable a \"Recurring\" functionality with optional parameters for frequency. Users can add a color to an event for recognition or to distinguish the event from others. Users can optionally set notifications, with options for type (email, mobile push notification) and time. Locations can be added for easy understanding of an event's place. Events are viewable in different types of setups, including day, week, month, or schedule. Users can invite other people to events; for other Google Calendar users, the event becomes visible in their calendar, and for non-Google Calendar users, an email will have options for \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Maybe\". Privacy settings allow the user to define the levels of public visibility of the entire calendar or individual events. Although the calendar defaults to showing users event times in their local time, users can specify a different time zone for an event. Users can enable or disable the visibility of special calendars, including a Birthdays calendar, that automatically retrieves dates of births from a user's Google contacts and displays the dates on a yearly basis, and a Holidays calendar, a country-specific calendar featuring dates of special occasions.[4]The user interface of Google Calendar was originally designed by Kevin Fox.[5] Google Calendar allows the user to import events from a different calendar application, with notable support for both Microsoft Outlook and Apple iCloud calendars.[6]In December 2010, Google added the ability for users to select a time zone for an event,[7] a notable feature that was previously missing; the feature's absence was criticized in the media.[8]In August 2015, Google added an \"Events from Gmail\" feature, where event information from a user's Gmail messages are automatically added to Google Calendar. The feature, enabled by default, will also update events with new information based on new email messages received, such as flight delays.[9][10]In December 2015, Google added a \"Reminders\" feature, enabling users to add to-do activities as Reminders, with those activities being displayed in the calendar alongside regular events. Google also states that Reminders can automatically add additional, helpful information to Reminders based on known details, such as numbers or addresses. Reminders serves as a cross-service feature, meaning Reminders also show up in Inbox by Gmail, Google Now, and Google Keep.[11]In January 2016, Google added \"Smart Suggestions\" to Google Calendar on their mobile apps. Smart suggestions will recommend titles of events, as well as locations and contacts.[12] At the same time as Smart Suggestions, Google also added holiday calendars for 54 new countries, adding up to a total of 143 country-specific holiday calendars.[13]In April 2016, Google added a \"Goals\" feature...Goals being activities the user wishes to complete. After answering brief questions, including \"How often?\" and \"Best time?\", Google Calendar will automatically \"find the best windows to pencil in time for that goal\", with the calendar adapting to the user's schedule over time, such as rescheduling a goal activity if an event is added that causes a direct conflict with the time of the goal.[14][15] The feature was expanded in January 2017 with support for Google Fit and Apple Health, to see the progress made towards completing a goal.[16][17]In March 2017, the iOS app was updated to feature support for the iPad,[18][19] and it was again updated in July to add a widget in the iOS \"Today\" panel.[20][21]In June 2017, following May's announcement of Google's new Family Groups feature across several of its services,[22][23] Google began rolling out \"family calendars\" for users in Google Calendar. The feature lets family members create shared events visible in a \"Family\" calendar option.[24]For users of Google's G Suite service, a subscription service for business, education and government customers that offers premium functionality, Google Calendar has a \"Find a time\" feature that can suggest the best time for an event with a group of people, based on available times for each individual in the group. Additionally, the feature can also schedule the meeting room.[25][26]Google Calendar entered a limited beta release on April 13, 2006,[27] and exited the beta stage in July 2009.[28] Initially only available on the web and on the Android operating system, an iOS app was released on March 10, 2015.[29][30]In a March 2015 review of the Android app, Sarah Mitroff of CNET wrote that the new Material Design-inspired app was \"cleaner\", with \"fewer distractions and colorful graphics that add a lot of personality to an otherwise dull app\". She praised the Smart Suggestions feature for making new event creation easy, adding that \"Even after just a few letters, the app will suggest the most relevant appointments. This is a great feature for creating events that occur over and over, like a haircut or doctor's appointment, because the app remembers the phrases you use\". She complimented the integration between Google Calendar and Gmail, writing that \"All of the relevant details are there, including confirmation numbers, links to the source email, even gate assignments for flights\", and called it \"one of my favorite parts of the app\", but also noted that the feature could be turned off. Furthermore, she praised \"the personal design touches that keep it from looking dull\", namely the app offering visual illustrations for certain types of events, like a bucket of popcorn for movie events, or a visual map of the event location, as well as themed illustrations for different months, including \"a snow-covered mountain and a skier\" for December. Overall, she wrote that Google Calendar \"is a reliable, simple and playful alternative to your device's built-in calendar\" and that it is \"efficient and a breeze to use\".[31]In contrast, Allyson Kazmucha of iMore criticized several aspects of the iPhone app. She wrote that \"The first thing you notice about Google Calendar is the bold interface\", adding that \"Google automatically detects certain event types and puts graphics behind them, which is a nice touch\". However, she criticized the amount of space the graphics take up, writing that \"it wastes a lot of space that could be used to show more events at a glance. It's not a huge peeve, but for anyone who has a busy calendar, it could result in a lot of scrolling\". She also criticized the Smart Suggestions, writing that \"in my short time using Google Calendar, the natural language support leaves a lot to be desired. I had trouble typing times or days and getting Google to understand it\". She did, however, like the view options available, writing that \"The three day view is one of my favorites\", but also noted that there was a lack of \"the ability to quickly drag events around to reschedule them\". Kazmucha also criticized the then-lack of a widget in the Notification Center, but wrote conclusively that \"Google Calendar is off to a good start but it isn't making me switch away from [current calendar app].\"[32]Derek Walter of Macworld, however, praised the iPhone app, writing that \"Itâs a gorgeous calendar app that mines your Gmail account to automatically add events\", with \"a splash of color and graphics for effect\". Walter also criticized the then-lack of a widget in the Notification Center, as well as the then-lack of iPad support. Walter called the Material Design \"rather elegant and polished, with a focus on parceling off information for easy viewing, registering touches with a subtle splash on the screen, and using a lot of visuals cues\", but noted that \"itâs not for everyone, especially if you prefer Appleâs design overhaul first introduced in iOS 7. Youâll also find that some elements of Material Design donât translate well to the iPhone, such as the loss of the slide gesture to go back\".[33]"

        "name": "Cardboard",
        "text": "Google Cardboard is a virtual reality (VR) platform developed by Google. Named for its fold-out cardboard viewer into which a smartphone is inserted, the platform is intended as a low-cost system to encourage interest and development in VR applications.[1][2] Users can either build their own viewer from simple, low-cost components using specifications published by Google, or purchase a pre-manufactured one. To use the platform, users run Cardboard-compatible mobile apps on their phone, place it into the back of the viewer, and view content through the lenses.The platform was created by David Coz and Damien Henry, French Google engineers at the Google Cultural Institute in Paris, in their 20% \"Innovation Time Off\".[3] It was introduced at the Google I/O 2014 developers conference, where a Cardboard viewer was given away to all attendees. The Cardboard software development kit (SDK) was released for the Android and iOS operating systems; the SDK's VR View allows developers to embed VR content on the web as well as in their apps.[4]Through March 2017, over 160 million Cardboard-enabled app downloads were made. By November 2019, over 15 million viewer units had shipped. After the success of Cardboard, Google developed an enhanced VR platform, Daydream, which was launched in 2016. Following declining interest in Cardboard, Google announced in November 2019 that it would open-source the Cardboard SDK.Google Cardboard headsets are built out of simple, low-cost components. The headset specifications were designed by Google, which made the list of parts, schematics, and assembly instructions freely available on their website, allowing people to assemble Cardboard themselves from readily available parts. Pre-manufactured viewers were only available from third-party vendors until February 2016, when Google began selling their own through the Google Store.[5]The parts that make up a Cardboard viewer are a piece of cardboard cut into a precise shape, 45 mm focal length lenses, magnets or capacitive tape, a hook and loop fastener (such as Velcro), a rubber band, and an optional near field communication (NFC) tag. Google provides extra recommendations for large scale manufacturing, and pre-assembled kits based on these plans are available for less than US$5[6] from multiple vendors, who have also created a number of Cardboard variations.Once the kit is assembled, a smartphone is inserted in the back of the device and held in place by the selected fastening device. A Google Cardboardâcompatible app splits the smartphone display image into two, one for each eye, while also applying barrel distortion to each image to counter pincushion distortion from the lenses.[7] The result is a stereoscopic (\"3D\") image with a wide field of view.The first version of Cardboard could fit phones with screens up to 5.7 inches (140 mm), and used magnets as input buttons, which required a compass sensor in the phone. An updated design released at Google I/O 2015 works with phones up to 6 inches (150 mm), and replaces the magnet switch with a conductive lever that triggers a touch event on the phone's screen for better compatibility across devices.Google provides three software development kits for developing Cardboard applications: one for the Android operating system using Java, one for the game engine Unity using C#, and one for the iOS operating system.[8] After initially supporting only Android, Google announced iOS support for the Unity plugin in May 2015 at the Google I/O 2015 conference.[9] Third-party apps with Cardboard support are available on the Google Play store[10] and App Store for iOS. In addition to native Cardboard apps, there are Google Chrome VR Experiments implemented using WebGL; phones, including Apple's, that support WebGL can run Google's web experiments.[11][12] A port of the Google Cardboard demonstration app to iOS was released at Google I/O 2015.[13] In January 2016, Google announced that the software development kits would support spatial audio, a virtual reality effect intended to simulate audio coming from outside of the listener's head located anywhere in 3D space.[14][15]In March 2016, Google released VR View, an expansion of the Cardboard SDK allowing developers to embed 360-degree VR content on a web page or in a mobile app, across desktop, Android, and iOS.[16] The JavaScript and HTML code for web publishing VR content is open source and available on GitHub, allowing developers to self-host their content.[17]On launch, the application offers icons for Cardboard Demos, 360 Video Channel, and Street View, with tabs for My Library and Get Apps. The Demos mode, set in a static scene above a beach, includes a brief tutorial option, a display of museum objects from all angles, a My Videos, a Photo Sphere, and an Arctic Journey with further options to explore aspects of interactivity. The demonstrations also included a Google Earth option that allowed interaction with a 3-D reconstruction of real terrain, but this appeared to have been removed as of late May 2019.[citation needed]Following declining interest in Cardboard, Google announced on November 6, 2019, that it would open-source the platform's SDK. The company said that it would continue \"adding new features\" to the project.[18]Jump is an ecosystem for virtual reality film-making developed by Google. It was announced at Google I/O on May 28, 2015. Much as Google did with the Cardboard viewer, for Jump the company developed specifications for a circular camera array made from 16 cameras that it will release to the public.[19] GoPro partnered with Google to build an array using their own cameras,[20] although the Jump rig will theoretically support any camera.[19] Once footage has been shot, the VR video is compiled from the individual cameras through \"the assembler\", Jump's back-end software. The assembler uses computational photography and \"computer vision\" to recreate the scene while generating thousands of in-between viewpoints.[19] Finalized video shot through Jump can then be viewed through a stereoscopic VR mode of YouTube with a Cardboard viewer.[19]Expeditions is a program for providing VR experiences to school classrooms through Google Cardboard viewers, allowing educators to take their students on virtual field trips.[21] It was announced at Google I/O 2015, with plans to launch in fall 2015.[22] Each classroom kit would include 30 synchronized Cardboard viewers and smartphones, along with a tablet for the teacher to act as tour guide.[23] Teachers interested in bringing the program to their school can register online.[24] CNET called Cardboard \"the first Virtual Reality platform targeted at children.\"[25] Through May 2016, over one million students had taken a VR field trip through the Expeditions program.[26] In July 2017, Google released a standalone version of the Expedition app, separating it from the platform's education initiative and making it available to the public.[27]In November 2014, Volvo released Volvo-branded Cardboard goggles and an Android app, Volvo Reality, to let the user explore the XC90.[28] In February 2015, toy manufacturer Mattel, in cooperation with Google, announced a VR version of the stereoscopic viewer View-Master. Android support was available at the viewer's release in fall 2015, with support for iOS and Windows smartphones available later.[29]Google also collaborated with LG Electronics to release a Cardboard-based headset for the LG G3 known as VR for G3. Released in February 2015, it was distributed as a free accessory with new G3 models sold in certain countries, and was perceived to be a competitor to the Samsung Gear VR accessory.[30]On November 8, 2015, The New York Times included a Google Cardboard viewer manufactured by Knoxlabs with all home newspaper deliveries. Readers can download the NYT VR app on their smartphone, which displays journalism-focused immersive VR environments.[31] Another newspaper, The Guardian, offered a similar promotion, giving away 97,000 Cardboard headsets to readers on October 7, 2017, while releasing a Guardian VR app for iOS and Android.[32]In December 2015, Google offered free Star Wars-themed Cardboard viewers through the Google Store and Verizon as a part of promotional tie-in for the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens.[33]Ticket holders for the 2016 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival received a Google Cardboardâinspired cardboard VR viewer in their welcome package that can be used with the Coachella VR mobile app. The festival's organizers partnered with Vantage.tv to offer VR content for the festival, such as 360Â° panoramic photos of previous events, virtual tours of the 2016 festival site, interviews, and performances.[34]On January 27, 2016, Google announced that in the platform's first 19 months, over 5 million Cardboard viewers had shipped, over 1,000 compatible applications had been published, and over 25 million application installs had been made. According to the company, users viewed over 350,000 hours of YouTube videos in VR during that time, and 500,000 students took a VR field trip through the Expeditions program.[35][36] Through March 2017, over 10 million Cardboard viewers had been shipped and over 160 million Cardboard-enabled app downloads had been made.[37] By November 2019, Google claimed that over 15 million viewer units had shipped worldwide.[18]The success of Cardboard convinced Google to develop more advanced virtual reality hardware and appoint a new chief of virtual reality.[38] Google announced an enhanced VR platform called Daydream at Google I/O on May 18, 2016.[39] The platform's first headset, the Daydream View, was released on November 10, 2016.[40]"

        "name": "Chromebook",
        "text": "A Chromebook is a laptop or tablet running the Linux-based Chrome OS as its operating system. The devices are primarily used to perform a variety of tasks using the Google Chrome browser, with most applications and data residing in the cloud rather than on the machine itself.[1][2][3] All Chromebooks released since late 2017 can also run Android apps. Some Chromebooks can run Linux apps.[4][5]The first Chromebooks for sale, by Acer Inc. and Samsung, began shipping on June 15, 2011.[6] In addition to laptop models, a desktop version, called a Chromebox, was introduced in May 2012, and an \"all-in-one\" device, called a Chromebase, was introduced in January 2014, by LG Electronics.In October 2012, Simon Phipps, writing in InfoWorld, said, \"The Chromebook line is probably the most successful Linux desktop/laptop computer we've seen to date\".[7] From January to November 2013, 1.76 million Chromebooks were sold in US business-to-business channels.[8]By March 2018, Chromebooks made up 60% of computers purchased by schools in the USA. In April 2017, the Electronic Frontier Foundation accused Google of using Chromebooks to collect and data mine \"school children's personal information, including their Internet searches\", without their parents' consent, two years after EFF had filed a federal complaint against the company.[9]The first Chromebooks for sale, by Acer Inc. and Samsung, were announced at the Google I/O conference in May 2011, and began shipping on June 15, 2011.[6] Lenovo, Hewlett Packard and Google itself entered the market in early 2013. In December 2013, Samsung launched a Samsung Chromebook specifically for the Indian market that employed the company's Exynos 5 Dual core processor.[10]Critical reaction to the device was initially skeptical, with some reviewers, such as then New York Times technology columnist David Pogue,[11] unfavorably comparing the value proposition of Chromebooks with that of more fully featured laptops running the Microsoft Windows operating system. That complaint dissipated later in reviews of machines from Acer and Samsung that were priced lower.[12]In February 2013, Google announced and began shipping the Chromebook Pixel, a higher-spec machine with a high-end price tag.[13]In January 2015, Acer announced the first big screen Chromebook, the Acer Chromebook 15 with an FHD 15.6-inch display.[14]Besides laptops, other devices run Chrome OS, as well. A desktop version, called a Chromebox, was introduced in May 2012 by Samsung.[15] The Chromebase, an \"all-in-one\" device, was introduced in January 2014 by LG Electronics.In March 2018, Acer and Google announced the first Chromebook tablet: the Chromebook Tab 10. The device was expected to compete with a lower-priced Apple iPad tablet in the education market. The Tab 10's displayâ9.7-inch, 2048 x 1536 resolutionâwas the same as the iPad's. The device included a stylus. Neither device included a keyboard.[16][17]In May 2016, Google announced it would make Android apps available on Chromebooks via the Google Play application distribution platform. At the time, Google Play access was scheduled for the ASUS Chromebook Flip, the Acer Chromebook R 11 and the most recent Chromebook Pixel, with other Chromebooks slated over time.[18][19][20] Partnering with Google, Samsung released the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro in early 2017, the first Chromebooks to come with the Play Store pre-installed.[21] A February 2017 review in The Verge reported that the Plus with its ARM processor handled Android apps \"much better\" than the Intel-based Pro, but said that \"Android apps on Chrome OS are still in beta\" and are \"very much [an] unfinished experience.\"[22] The number of Chrome OS systems supporting Android apps in either the stable or beta channel is increasing.[23][24]In May 2018, Google announced it would make Linux desktop apps available on Chromebooks via a Virtual Machine code-named \"Crostini\"[25]Initial hardware partners for Chromebook development included Acer, Adobe, Asus, Freescale, Hewlett-Packard (later HP Inc.), Lenovo, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Toshiba,[26] Intel,[27] Samsung,[28][29] and Dell.[30]Chromebooks ship with Google Chrome OS, an operating system that uses the Linux kernel and the Google Chrome web-browser with an integrated media-player.[31][32] Enabling developer mode allows the installation of Linux distributions on Chromebooks. Crouton is a script that allows the installation of Linux distributions from Chrome OS, and running both operating systems simultaneously.[33] Some Chromebooks include SeaBIOS, which can be turned on to install and boot Linux distributions directly.[34][35] With limited offline capability and a fast boot-time, Chromebooks are primarily designed for use while connected to the Internet[36] and signed in to a Google account.[37] Instead of installing traditional applications such as word processing and instant messaging, users add web apps from the Chrome Web Store.[38] Google claims that a multi-layer security architecture eliminates the need for anti-virus software.[6]Support for many USB devices such as cameras, mice, external keyboards and flash drives is included, utilizing a feature similar to plug-and-play on other operating systems. Like the prototype Cr-48, Chromebooks have a specialized keyboard complete with buttons for opening and controlling multiple browser-windows, as well as a Web search button which replaces the caps lock key (caps lock being activated by pressing both alt+search).[citation needed]An analysis of the Samsung Series 5 components by iFixit in June 2011, estimated a total cost of $334.32, representing US$322.12 in materials and US$12.20 in labor. With an initial retail price of US$499.99 that also pays for retail margins, shipping, marketing, and research and development, the profit margins on the Chromebooks are quite thin, requiring a large production run to make a profit.[39]While Chromebooks are designed to be used when connected to the Internet, users are able to access Google applications such as Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Drive in offline mode. Chromebooks also come with a built-in local music-player, a photo editor, and a PDF- and Microsoft Office document-viewer that are functional without Internet access. Other apps with offline support include Amazon's Cloud Reader, the New York Times App, and Angry Birds.[40][41] Google Play video content is available offline using an extension to the Chrome browser.[42]All Chromebooks, except the first three, boot with the help of Coreboot, a fast-booting BIOS.[43][44]The integration of Android and Chrome, announced in 2016, is anticipated to drive the design and form factor of future Chromebooks,[20] including an expected first Chrome OS tablet.[45]The first two commercially available Chromebooks, the Samsung Series 5 and the Acer AC700, were unveiled on May 11, 2011, at the Google I/O developer conference. They were to begin selling through online channels, including Amazon and Best Buy in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain starting June 15, 2011; however, Acer's AC700 was not available until early July.[46] The first machines sold for between $349 and $499, depending on the model and 3G option.[47] Google also offered a monthly payment scheme for business and education customers at $28 and $20 per user, per month, respectively for a three-year contract, including replacements and upgrades. Verizon offers models equipped with 3G/4G LTE connectivity 100â200 MB of free wireless data per month, for two years.[48][49]Google's early marketing efforts relied primarily on hands-on experience: giving away Samsung machines to 10 Cr-48 pilot program participants along with the title Chromebook Guru and lending Chromebooks to passengers on some Virgin America flights.[50][51][52]At the end of September 2011, Google launched the Chrome Zone, a \"store within a store\", inside the Currys and PC World superstore in London.[53] The store had a Google-style look and feel with splashes of color all around the retail store front.[54] The concept was later changed to a broader in-store Google shop, which has not expanded beyond the PC World on Tottenham Court Road.[55]In addition to these marketing strategies, Google Chrome has created several \"Chromebook minis\" that demonstrate the ease of use and simplicity of the devices in a comical manner. For example, when the question \"How do you back up a Chromebook\" is asked, it is implied to refer to data backup, but instead, shows two hands pushing a Chromebook back to the end of a table. This is followed by the statement, \"You don't have to back up a Chromebook,\" showing how all data is stored on the web.[56]In an article published on ZDNet in June 2011, entitled \"Five Chromebook concerns for businesses\", Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols faulted the devices for lack of virtual private network capability, not supporting some Wi-Fi security methods, in particular Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) Enterprise with Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) or Cisco's Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP). He also noted that its file manager does not work, the need to use the undocumented crosh shell to accomplish basic tasks such as setting up a secure shell (SSH) network connection as well as serious deficiencies in documentation.[57]In one of the first customer reviews, the City of Orlando, Florida, reported on their initial testing of 600 Chromebooks as part of a broader study related to accessing virtual desktops. Early indications show potential value in reducing IT support costs. End users have indicated that the Chromebook is easy to travel with and starts up quickly. One stated that \"If I just need to stay connected for emergencies, I take my Chrome,\" but when traveling for business she would still take her laptop. Orlando does plan to continue to use the Chromebooks.[58]On November 21, 2011, Google announced price reductions on all Chromebooks.[59] Since then, the Wi-Fi-only Samsung Series 5 was reduced to $349, the 3G Samsung Series 5 was reduced to $449, and the Acer AC700 was reduced to $299.The updated Series 5 550 and the Chromebox, the first Chrome OS desktop machines, were released by Samsung in May 2012.[60][61][62][63] While the two lowest cost Chromebooks emerged later in the fall: the $249[64] Samsung Series 3 and the $199[65] Acer C7. The following February, Google introduced the most costly machine, their Chromebook Pixel, with a starting price of $1299.[66] All models released after May 2012, include 100 GBâ1.09 TB of Google Drive cloud storage and 12 GoGo WiFi passes.[67][68]By January 2013, Acer's Chromebook sales were being driven by \"heavy Internet users with educational institutions\", and the platform represented 5-10 percent of the company's US shipments, according to Acer president Jim Wong. He called those numbers sustainable, contrasting them with low Windows 8 sales which he blamed for a slump in the market. Wong said that the company would consider marketing Chromebooks to other developed countries, as well as to corporations. He noted that although Chrome OS is free to license for hardware vendors, it has required greater marketing expenditure than Windows, offsetting the licensing savings.[69]During the first 11 months of 2013, 1.76 million Chromebooks sold in the United States, representing 21% of the US commercial business-to-business laptop market. During the same period in 2012, Chromebooks sold 400,000 units and had a negligible market share.[8]In January 2015, Silviu Stahie noted in Softpedia that Chromebooks were eating into Microsoft's market share. He said \"Microsoft is engaged in a silent war and it's actually losing. They are fighting an enemy that is so insidious and so cunning that it's actually hurting the company more than anything else. The enemy is called Chromebooks and they are using Linux...There is no sign that things are slowing down and Microsoft really needs a win, and soon if it wants to remain relevant.\"[70]In 2015, Chromebooks, by sales volume (to companies in the US), are second after Windows based devices (with Android tablets, overtaking Apple's devices in 2014): \"Chromebook sales through the U.S. B2B channels increased 43 percent during the first half of 2015, helping to keep overall B2B PC and tablet sales from falling. [..] Sales of Google OS-equipped (Android and Chrome) devices saw a 29 percent increase over 2014 propelled by Chromebook sales, while Apple devices declined 12 percent and Windows devices fell 8 percent.\"[71]The education market has been the Chromebooks' most notable success, competing on the low cost of the hardware, software and upkeep. The simplicity of the machines, which could be a drawback in other markets, has proven an advantage to school districts by reducing training and maintenance costs.[72]By January 2012, even while commercial sales were flat, Google placed nearly 27,000 Chromebooks in schools across 41 states in the US, including \"one-on-one\" programs, which allocate a computer for every student in South Carolina, Illinois, and Iowa.[73] As of August 2012, over 500 school districts in the United States and Europe were using the device.[74][75] In 2016, Chromebooks represented 58 percent of the 2.6 million mobile devices purchased by U.S. schools and about 64 percent of that market outside the U.S. By contrast, sales of Apple tablets and laptops to U.S. schools dropped that year to 19 percent, compared with 52 percent in 2012.[72]Helping spur Chromebook sales is Google Classroom, an app designed for teachers in 2014, that serves as a hub for classroom activities including attendance, classroom discussions, homework, and communication with students and parents.[72]There have, however, been concerns about privacy within the context of the education market for Chromebooks. School officials at schools issuing Chromebooks for students have affirmed that students have no right to privacy when using school-issued Chromebooks, even at home, and that all online and offline activity can be monitored by the school using third-party software pre-installed on the laptops.[76] Further, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has complained that Google itself is violating the privacy of students, by enabling the synchronisation function within Google Chrome (\"Chrome Sync\") by default, allowing web browsing histories and other data of students - including those under-13 - to be stored on Google servers and potentially used for purposes other than authorised educational purposes.[77][78] A point of contention has been the fact that users of school-issued Chromebooks cannot change these settings themselves as a measure to protect their privacy as only the administrator who issued the laptops can change them.[77][78] The EFF claims that this violates a Student Privacy Pledge already signed by Google in 2014.[77][78][79] EFF staff attorney Nate Cardozo stated: \"Minors shouldn't be tracked or used as guinea pigs, with their data treated as a profit center. If Google wants to use students' data to 'improve Google products', then it needs to get express consent from parents.\"[77]By March 2018 Chromebooks made up 60% of computers used in schools. CNet writer Alfred Ng cited superior security as the main reason for this level of market adoption.[80]Google supports its chipsets for a maximum of 6.5 years. As of November 2019, Chromium OS reports the product end of life date in the \"About this Chromebook\" section of device settings.[81](31.2 cm)(1.29 kg)Celeron N3450[104]8 GB(1.26kg)32 GB64 GB (C732, C732T)(C732T)The hardware generation and Linux kernel version[110] of most products can be inferred from the code name[111] and its corresponding video game series:At a December 7, 2010, press briefing,[112][113][114] Google announced the Chrome OS Pilot Program, a pilot experiment and the first Chromebook, the Cr-48 Chrome Notebook, a prototype, to test the Chrome OS operating system and modified hardware for it. The device had a minimal design and was all black, completely unbranded although it was made by Inventec,[115] and had a rubberized coating. The device was named after Chromium-48, an unstable isotope of the metallic element Chromium,[116] and the participants were named Cr-48 Test Pilots. Google distributed about 60,000 Cr-48 Chrome Notebooks between December 2010 and March 2011[117][118] for free to participants and in return asked for feedback such as suggestions and bug reports. The Cr-48 was intended for testing only, not retail sales.[119][120][121]The Cr-48's hardware design broke convention by replacing certain keys with shortcut keys,[122] such as the function keys, and replacing the caps lock key with a dedicated search key,[123] which can be changed back to caps lock in the OS's keyboard settings. Google addressed complaints that the operating system offers little functionality when the host device is not connected to the Internet, demonstrated an offline version of Google Docs, and announced a 3G plan that would give users 100 MB of free data each month, with additional paid plans available from Verizon.[36][124]The device's USB port is capable of supporting a keyboard, mouse, Ethernet adapter, or USB storage, but not a printer, as Chrome OS offers no print stack.[125] Adding further hardware outside of the previously mentioned items will likely cause problems with the operating system's \"self knowing\" security model.[126] Users instead were encouraged to use a secure service called Google Cloud Print to print to legacy printers connected to their desktop computers, or to connect an HP ePrint, Kodak Hero, Kodak ESP, or Epson Connect printer to the Google Cloud Print service for a \"cloud aware\" printer connection.[127]The Cr-48 prototype laptop gave reviewers their first opportunity to evaluate Chrome OS running on a device. Ryan Paul of Ars Technica wrote that the machine \"met the basic requirements for Web surfing, gaming, and personal productivity, but falls short for more intensive tasks.\" He praised Google's approach to security, but wondered whether mainstream computer users would accept an operating system whose only application is a browser. He thought Chrome OS \"could appeal to some niche audiences\": people who just need a browser or companies that rely on Google Apps and other Web applications. But the operating system was \"decidedly not a full-fledged alternative to the general purpose computing environments that currently ship on netbooks.\" Paul wrote that most of Chrome OS's advantages \"can be found in other software environments without having to sacrifice native applications.\"[117]In reviewing the Cr-48 on December 29, 2010, Kurt Bakke of Conceivably Tech wrote that a Chromebook had become the most frequently used family appliance in his household. \"Its 15 second startup time and dedicated Google user accounts made it the go-to device for quick searches, email as well as YouTube and Facebook activities.\" But the device did not replace other five notebooks in the house: one for gaming, two for the kids, and two more for general use. \"The biggest complaint I heard was its lack of performance in Flash applications.\"[128]In ongoing testing, Wolfgang Gruener, also writing in Conceivably Tech, said that cloud computing at cellular data speeds is unacceptable and that the lack of offline ability turns the Cr-48 \"into a useless brick\" when not connected.[129] \"It's difficult to use the Chromebook as an everyday device and give up what you are used to on a Mac/Windows PC, while you surely enjoy the dedicated cloud computing capabilities occasionally.\"[130]The Cr-48 features an Intel Atom 455, a single-core processor with 512 KB of cache and hyperthreading enabled. It also features 2 GB of removable DDR3 memory in a single SO-DIMM, integrated chipset graphics, and a 66 watt-hour battery.[131] It has been found that the Intel NM10 chipset can get very hot during operation due to lack of a proper heatsink, but this has been fixed in production Chromebooks.[citation needed]Launched by Google in February 2013, the Chromebook Pixel was the high-end machine in the Chromebook family. The laptop has an unusual 3:2 display aspect ratio touch screen featuring what was at its debut the highest pixel density of any laptop,[132] a faster CPU than its predecessors in the Intel Core i5, and an exterior design described by Wired as \"an austere rectangular block of aluminum with subtly rounded edges\".[133] A second Pixel featuring LTE wireless communication and twice the storage capacity was shipped for arrival on April 12, 2013.[134]The machine received much media attention, with many reviewers questioning the Pixel's value proposition compared to similarly priced Windows machines and the MacBook Air.[135][136]In 2017, Google launched the Pixelbook to replace the Chromebook Pixel. Like the Chromebook Pixel, the Pixelbook has a 3:2 aspect ratio touchscreen with a high pixel density display.[137]. Unlike the original Chromebook Pixel but like the second generation, the Pixelbook excludes an option for LTE. Instead, it implements Google's \"instant tethering\", which automatically tethers a Pixelbook to a Pixel phone's mobile connection.[138]Reviewing the Samsung Series 5 specifications, Scott Stein of CNET was unimpressed with a machine with a 12-inch screen and just 16 GB of onboard storage. \"Chrome OS might be lighter than Windows XP, but we'd still prefer more media storage space. At this price, you could also get an 11.6-inch (290 mm) Wi-Fi AMD E-350-powered ultraportable running Windows 7.\"[61] On the other hand, MG Siegler of TechCrunch wrote a largely favorable review, praising the improvements in speed and trackpad sensitivity over the CR-48 prototype, as well as the long battery life and the fact that all models are priced below the iPad.[139]In June 2011, iFixit dismantled a Samsung Series 5 and concluded that it was essentially an improved Cr-48. They rated it as 6/10 for repairability, predominantly because the case has to be opened to change the battery and because the RAM chip is soldered to the motherboard. iFixit noted that the \"mostly-plastic construction\" felt \"a little cheap\". On the plus side they stated that the screen was easy to remove and most of the components, including the solid-state drive would be easy to replace. iFixit's Kyle Wiens wrote that the Series 5 \"fixes the major shortfalls of the Cr-48 and adds the polish necessary to strike lust into the heart of a broad consumer base: sleek looks, 8+ hours of battery life, and optimized performance.\"[140]In May 2012, Samsung introduced the Chromebook Series 5 550, with a Wi-Fi model and more expensive 3G model.[141]Reviews generally questioned the value proposition. Dana Wollman of Engadget wrote that the Chromebook's keyboard \"put thousand-dollar Ultrabooks to shame\" and offered better display quality than on many laptops selling for twice as much. But the price \"seems to exist in a vacuumâa place where tablet apps aren't growing more sophisticated, where Transformer-like Win8 tablets aren't on the way and where there aren't some solid budget Windows machines to choose from.\"[142]Joe Wilcox of BetaNews wrote that \"price to performance and how it compares to other choices\" is \"where Chromebook crumbles for many potential buyers.\" He noted that the new models sell for more than their predecessors, and while the price-performance ratio is quite favorable compared to the MacBook Air, \"by the specs, there are plenty of lower-cost options.\"[143]In October 2012, the Series 3 Chromebook was introduced at a San Francisco event with the Samsung Chromebook XE303. The device was cheaper, thinner and lighter than the Chromebook 550. Google marketed the Series 3 as the computer for everyone, due to its simple operating system (Chrome OS) and affordable price. Target markets included students and first-time computer users, as well as households looking for an extra computer.[144][145]The lower price proved a watershed for some reviewers. New York Times technology columnist David Pogue reversed his earlier thumbs-down verdict on the Chromebook, writing that \"$250 changes everything.\" The price is half that of an \"iPad, even less than an iPad Mini or an iPod Touch. And youâre getting a laptop.\" He wrote that the Chromebook does many of the things people use computers and laptops for: playing flash videos, and opening Microsoft Office documents. \"In other words, Google is correct when it asserts that the Chromebook is perfect for schools, second computers in homes and businesses who deploy hundreds of machines.\"[11][12]CNET's review of the Series 3 Chromebook was even more favorable, saying the machine largely delivered as a computer for students and as an additional computer for a householdâespecially for users who are already using Google Web applications like Google Docs, Google Drive, and Gmail. \"It's got workable if not standout hardware, its battery life is good, it switches on quickly, and the $249 price tag means it's not as much of a commitment as the $550 Samsung Series 5 550 that arrived in May.\" The review subtracted points for performance. \"It's fine for many tasks, but power users accustomed to having more than a couple dozen browser tabs open should steer clear.\"[144]The Chromebook 3 is distinct from and distinguished from the similarly named Samsung Series 3 in several respects: newer (released 2016), different architecture (Intel Celeron N3050 instead of Exynos 5 Dual ARM Cortex),[146] thinner (0.7\"),[146] and less expensive (about $100 less than the Series 3);[146] while remaining a full implementation of ChromeOS.HP's first Chromebook, and the largest Chromebook on the market at that time, was the Pavilion 14 Chromebook launched February 3, 2013.[147] It had an Intel Celeron 847 CPU and either 2GB or 4GB of RAM. Battery life was not long, at just over 4 hours, but the larger form factor made it more friendly for all-day use. HP introduced the Chromebook 11 on October 8, 2013, in the US.[148] In December 2013, Google and HP recalled 145,000 chargers due to overheating.[149] Sales were halted, resuming with a redesigned charger the following month.[150] The HP Chromebook 14 was announced September 11, 2013[151] with an Intel Haswell Celeron processor, USB 3.0 ports, and 4G broadband. An updated version of the Chromebook lineup was announced on September 3, 2014. The 11-inch models included an Intel processor while the 14-inch models featured a fanless design powered by a Nvidia Tegra K1 processor. HP Chromebooks are available in several colors.[152]Two types of desktop computers also run Chrome OS.Classed as small form-factor PCs, Chromeboxes typically feature a power switch and a set of ports: local area network, USB, DVI-D, DisplayPort, and audio. As with Chromebooks, Chromeboxes employ solid-state memory and support Web applications, but require an external monitor, keyboard, and pointing device.[153]Chromebase is an \"all-in-one\" Chrome OS device. The first such model was released by LG Electronics which integrated a screen, speakers, 1.3-megapixel webcam and microphone, with a suggested retail price of $350. The company unveiled the product in January 2014, at International CES in Las Vegas.[154][155]The Chromebit is a dongle running on Google's Chrome OS operating system. When placed in the HDMI port of a television or a monitor, this device turns that display into a personal computer. Chromebit allows adding a keyboard or mouse over Bluetooth or via the USB port.HDMI does not provide power to connected devices, so the Chromebit is supplied power from either an external USB power supply, or draws power via a USB port on the monitor, that would otherwise be used for displaying pictures on a flash drive on the monitor."

        "name": "Chromecast",
        "text": "Chromecast is a line of digital media players developed by Google. The devices, designed as small dongles, enable users with a mobile device or personal computer to play Internet-streamed audio-visual content on a high-definition television or home audio system through mobile and web apps that support the Google Cast technology. Alternatively, content can be mirrored from the Google Chrome web browser running on a personal computer, as well as from the screen of some Android devices.The first-generation Chromecast, a video streaming device, was announced on July 24, 2013, and made available for purchase on the same day in the United States for US$35.[4] The second-generation Chromecast and an audio-only model called Chromecast Audio were released in September 2015. A model called Chromecast Ultra that supports 4K resolution and high dynamic range was released in November 2016. A third generation of the HD video Chromecast was released in October 2018.Critics praised the Chromecast's simplicity and potential for future app support. The Google Cast SDK was released on February 3, 2014, allowing third parties to modify their software to work with Chromecast and other Cast receivers. According to Google, over 20,000 Google Castâready apps are available, as of May 2015. Over 30 million units have sold globally since launch, making the Chromecast the best-selling streaming device in the United States in 2014, according to NPD Group. From Chromecast's launch to May 2015, it handled more than 1.5 billion stream requests.According to Google, the Chromecast was originally conceived by engineer Majd Bakar. His inspiration for the product came around 2008 after noticing the film-viewing tendencies of his wife Carla Hindie. Using her laptop, she would search for a film to watch on a streaming service and add it to her queue, before closing her laptop and using a gaming device to play the film on a television. Carla took these steps because she found television interfaces difficult to use to search for content. Bakar found the whole process inefficient and wanted to build a phone-based interface that would allow video to play on a large display through a small hardware device. After joining Google in 2011 to work on products that \"would change how people used their TVs\", Bakar pitched the idea for the Chromecast. Development on the product began in 2012; late that year, Bakar brought home a beta version of the product for Carla to test. The device was launched in July 2013.[5]Chromecast offers two methods to stream content: the first employs mobile and web apps that support the Google Cast technology; the second allows mirroring of content from the web browser Google Chrome running on a personal computer, as well as content displayed on some Android devices.[6] In both cases, playback is initiated through the \"cast\" button on the sender device.[7]When no content is streamed, video-capable Chromecasts display a user-personalizable content feed called \"Backdrop\" that can include featured and personal photos, artwork, weather, satellite images, weather forecasts, and news.[8]If a television's HDMI ports support the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) feature, pressing the cast button will also result in the video-capable Chromecast automatically turning on the TV and switching the television's active audio/video input using the CEC command \"One Touch Playback\".[9]Chromecast devices are dongles that are powered by connecting the device's micro-USB port to an external power supply or a USB port. Video-capable Chromecasts plug into the HDMI port of a high-definition television or monitor, while the audio-only model outputs sound through its integrated 3.5 millimeter audio jack/mini-TOSLINK socket. By default, Chromecasts connect to the Internet through a Wi-Fi connection to the user's local network; a standalone USB power supply with an Ethernet port, introduced in July 2015 for US$15, allows for a wired connection.[10]The original Chromecast measures 2.83 inches (72 mm) in length and has an HDMI plug built into the body.[11] It contains the Marvell Armada 1500-mini 88DE3005 system on a chip running an ARM Cortex-A9 processor. The SoC includes codecs for hardware decoding of the VP8 and H.264 video compression formats. Radio communication is handled by AzureWave NHâ387 Wi-Fi which implements 802.11 b/g/n (2.4 GHz). The device has 512 MB of Micron DDR3L RAM and 2 GB of flash storage.[12][13]The model number H2G2-42 is likely a reference to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy abbreviation \"H2G2\"âin the novel, the number 42 is the \"Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.\"[12][14] The bundled power adapter bears the model number MST3K-US, a reference to the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000.[15]The second-generation Chromecast has a disc-shaped body with a short length of HDMI cable attached (as opposed to the HDMI plug built into the original model). The cable is flexible and can magnetically attach to the device body for more positioning options behind a television. The second-generation model uses a Marvell Armada 1500 Mini Plus 88DE3006 SoC, which has dual ARM Cortex-A7 processors running at 1.2 GHz. The unit contains an Avastar 88W8887, which has improved Wi-Fi performance and offers support for 802.11 ac and 5 GHz bands, while containing three adaptive antennae for better connections to home routers.[16][17][18] The device contains 512 MB of Samsung DDR3L RAM and 256 MB of flash storage.[19]The model number NC2-6A5 may be a reference to the registry number \"NCC-1701\" of the fictional starship USS Enterprise from the Star Trek franchise, the \"saucer section\" of which the device resembles: NC2 can be read as NCC, and 6A5 converted from hexadecimal is 1701.[20]The third-generation Chromecast was launched in October 2018. It supports 1080p video at 60fps, but does not support 4K video.Introduced in September 2015, Chromecast Audio is a variation of the second-generation Chromecast designed for use with audio streaming apps.Chromecast Audio features a 3.5 millimeter audio jack/mini-TOSLINK socket, allowing the device to be attached to speakers and home audio systems.[21] One side of the device is inscribed with circular grooves, resembling those of a vinyl record.[22] A December 2015 update introduced support for high-resolution audio (24-bit/96 kHz) and multi-room playback; users can simultaneously play audio across multiple Chromecast Audio devices in different locations by grouping them together using the Google Home mobile app.[23] The feature made Chromecast Audio a low-cost alternative to Sonos' multiple-room music systems.[24]With the advent of Google Home smart speakers, the device became tangential to Google's product strategy and was discontinued in January 2019.[25] In addition, 3rd gen Chromecast supports Chromecast Audio technology.[26]The model number RUX-J42 may have been a reference to the Jimi Hendrix albums Are You Experienced (stylized \"R U eXperienced\") and Midnight Lightning, which had the internal code J-42. Chromecast Audio was also developed with the internal codename Hendrix.[27]Chromecast Ultra is similar in design to the second-generation model, but features upgraded hardware that supports the streaming of 4K resolution content, as well as high-dynamic range through the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats. Google stated that the Chromecast Ultra loads video 1.8 times faster than previous models.[28] Unlike previous models that could be powered through a USB port, the Chromecast Ultra requires the use of the included power supply for connecting to a wall outlet. The power supply also offers an Ethernet port for a wired connection to accommodate the fast network speeds needed to stream 4K content.[29]At the time of Chromecast's launch, four compatible apps were available: YouTube and Netflix were supported as Android, iOS, and Chrome web apps; Google Play Music and Google Play Movies & TV were also supported, but originally only as Android apps.[38][39] Additional Chromecast-enabled apps would require access to the Google Cast software development kit (SDK). The SDK was first released as a preview version on July 24, 2013. Google advised interested developers to use the SDK to create and test Chromecast-enabled apps, but not distribute them.[40] While that admonition remained in force, Chromecast-enabled applications for Hulu Plus and Pandora Radio were released in October 2013, and HBO Go in November.[41][42] Google opened the SDK to all developers on February 3, 2014.[43] In its introductory documentation and video presentation, Google said the SDK worked with both Chromecast devices and other unnamed \"cast receiver devices\". Chromecast product manager Rish Chandra said that Google used the intervening time to improve the SDK's reliability and accommodate those developers who sought a quick and easy way to cast a photo to a television without a lot of coding.[44][45]Over time, many more applications have been updated to support Chromecast. At Google I/O 2014, the company announced that 6,000 registered developers were working on 10,000 Google Castâready apps;[46] by the following year's conference, the number of compatible apps had doubled.[47] Google's official list of compatible apps and platforms is available on the Chromecast website. Google has published case studies documenting Chromecast integration by Comedy Central, Just Dance Now, Haystack TV and Fitnet.[48]In July 2019, the Amazon Prime apps for Android and iOS added Chromecast support, marking the first time Amazon's streaming service supported the device. The move followed a four-year dispute between Google and Amazon in which Amazon stopped selling Chromecast devices and Google pulled YouTube from Amazon Fire TV.[49][50]The development framework has two components: a sender app based on a vendor's existing Android or iOS mobile app, or desktop Web app, which provides users with content discovery and media controls; and a receiver app, executing in a Chrome browser-like environment resident on the cast receiver device. Both make use of APIs provided by the SDK.[44]Chromecast uses the mDNS (multicast Domain Name System) protocol to search for available devices on a Wi-Fi network.[51] Chromecast previously used the DIAL (Discovery and Launch) protocol,[52] co-developed by Netflix and YouTube.[53]At the introductory press conference, Mario Queiroz, Google's VP of Product Management, said that the first-generation Chromecast ran \"a simplified version of Chrome OS.\"[54] Subsequently, a team of hackers reported that the device is \"more Android than ChromeOS\" and appears to be adapted from software embedded in Google TV.[55][56] As with Chrome OS devices, Chromecast operating system updates are downloaded automatically without notification.[57]Chromecast is managed through the Google Home app, which enables users to set up new devices and configure existing ones (such as specifying which \"Backdrop\" images are shown when no other content is cast). Users can also search for streaming content that is available on installed Google Cast-enabled apps. The app manages other Google Cast-supported devices, including the Google Home smart speaker.[58][59]Originally called simply \"Chromecast\", the app was released concurrently with the original Chromecast video model and is available for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The app was released outside the US in October 2013.[60]In May 2016, the Chromecast app was renamed Google Cast due to the proliferation of non-Chromecast products that support casting.[61] In October 2016, Google Cast was renamed Google Home, the name also given to the company's smart speakerâleaving \"Google Cast\" as the name of the technology.[62]Google made the first-generation Chromecast available for purchase online in the US on July 24, 2013. To entice consumers, Google initially included a promotion for three months of access to Netflix at no cost with the purchase of a Chromecast. The device quickly sold out on Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, and Google Play, and within 24 hours, the Netflix promotion was ended because of high demand.[63][64] On March 18, 2014, Google released the Chromecast to 11 new markets, including the UK, Germany and Canada[65] with the BBC iPlayer enabled for UK users.[66]In July 2014, to commemorate the first anniversary of the device's launch, Google announced it would offer their music streaming service, Google Play Music All Access, at no cost for 90 days to Chromecast owners who had not previously used All Access; the service normally costs US$9.99 per month.[67] On December 10, 2014, Chromecast was launched in India through e-commerce marketplace Snapdeal in partnership with Bharti Airtel.[68] That same month, Google offered a promotion whereby anyone purchasing a Chromecast from a participating retailer before December 21 would receive a US$20 credit for the Google Play Store.[69] Google offered a US$6 credit to the Store for all Chromecast owners beginning on February 6, 2015.[70]On September 29, 2015, Google announced the second-generation Chromecast and an audio-only model called Chromecast Audio. Each model was made available for purchase the same day for US$35.[71] Days later, Amazon.com announced that it would ban the sale of Chromecast and Apple TV devices, presumably because they compete with Amazon's own Fire TV and Fire TV Stick.[72] Google discontinued Chromecast Audio in January 2019.[25]On October 4, 2016, Google announced Chromecast Ultra during the \"Made by Google\" event, alongside other products such as Google Home, Google Wifi, and the Daydream View.Nilay Patel of The Verge gave the Chromecast an 8.5/10 score in his review, saying, \"The Chromecast is basically an impulse purchase that just happens to be the simplest, cheapest, and best solution for getting a browser window on your TV.\" Speaking of the adapter's potential, he said, \"it seems like the Chromecast might actually deliver on all that potential, but Google still has a lot of work to do.\" In particular, Patel pointed to Apple's AirPlay protocol as an example of an established competitor with many more features.[73] TechCrunch's review of the device said, \"Even with a bug or two rearing its head, the Chromecast is easily worth its $35 pricetag.\"[74] Gizmodo gave the device a positive review, highlighting the ease of setup and sharing video. In comparing the device to competitors, the review said, \"Chromecast isn't Google's version of Apple TV, and it's not trying to be... But Chromecast also costs a third of what those devices do, and has plenty of potential given that its SDK is just a few days old.\"[75]Michael Gorman of Engadget gave the Chromecast an 84/100 score, writing, \"it's a platform that's likely to improve dramatically as more apps start to support the technology.\" In his comparing the Chromecast to competing devices, Gorman illustrated that it initially had support from fewer multimedia services, but because of its low price and ease of use, he concluded \"we can wholeheartedly recommend the Chromecast for anyone who's been looking for an easy, unobtrusive way to put some brains into their dumb TV.\"[76] Will Greenwald of PC Magazine rated it 4/5, saying, \"The Google Chromecast is the least expensive way to access online services on your HDTV\", although he noted that \"The lack of local playback and limited Chrome integration holds it back in some respects.\"[77] David Pogue of The New York Times praised the device for its $35 retail price, saying, \"It's already a fine price for what this gadget does, and it will seem better and better the more video apps are made to work with it.\" Pogue noted the limitations of the device's screen mirroring feature and said using only mobile devices as a remote control was not \"especially graceful\", but he called Chromecast the \"smallest, cheapest, simplest way yet to add Internet to your TV\".[78]In July 2014, Google announced that in the device's first year on sale, \"millions\" of units had sold and over 400 million casts had been made.[79] The number of casts surpassed one billion by January 2015,[80] and 1.5 billion by May 2015.[81] The company confirmed that Chromecast was the best-selling media streaming device in the United States in 2014, according to NPD Group.[80] In February 2015, Google Korea announced that about 10 million Chromecasts had been sold globally in 2014.[82] At Google I/O in May 2015, the company announced 17 million units had sold since launch,[83] a figure that reached 20 million by September 2015,[84] 25 million by May 2016,[85] and 30 million by July 2016.[2] According to Strategy Analytics, Chromecast captured more than 35% of the digital streamer market internationally in 2015.[86] As of October 2017, over 55 million Chromecasts and Chromecast built-in devices have been sold.[3]Digital Trends named Chromecast the \"Best Product of 2013\".[87] In March 2014, Engadget named Chromecast an Editor's Choice winner for \"Home Theater Product of the Year\" as part of the website's annual awards;[88] for the following year's awards, Engadget named the device the winner of \"Best in Home Entertainment\".[89]In July 2015, Google signed a deal with the Television Academy to provide Chromecasts to Emmy Award voters to allow them to view screeners of nominated media. The multi-year agreement will reduce the volume of DVD screeners distributed each year.[90]In the face of stronger competition from devices such as the Apple TV, Roku or Fire TV, reviewers started to consider the 2018 Chromecast a secondary streaming device.[91] Trusted reviews considered it a \"very minor\" upgrade.[92] Tom's Guide said it has almost \"nothing to show\" to reflect three years of hardware advancement in the streaming space.[93]On January 3, 2019, hackers took control of Chromecast devices, stating they were exposing security risks. The hackers claimed to access 70,000 devices through a router setting that makes connected devices viewable to the public.[94] The bug was dubbed CastHack, and was first found in 2014 by the security consultancy firm Bishop Fox and observed again in 2016.[95]"

        "name": "Contacts",
        "text": "A contact lens, or simply contact, is a thin lens placed directly on the surface of the eye. Contact lenses are ocular prosthetic devices used by over 150 million people worldwide,[1] and they can be worn to correct vision, for cosmetic, or therapeutic reasons.[2] In 2004, it was estimated that 125 million people worldwide use contact lenses, including 28 to 38 million in the United States.[3] In 2010, the worldwide market for contact lenses was estimated at $6.1 billion, while the US soft lens market was estimated at $2.1 billion.[4] Multiple analysts estimated that the global market for contact lenses would reach $11.7 billion by 2015.[4] As of 2010, the average age of contact lens wearers globally was 31 years old, and two-thirds of wearers were female.[5]People choose to wear contact lenses for many reasons.[6] Aesthetics and cosmetics are the main motivating factors for people who want to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes.[7] Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.[8]Leonardo da Vinci is frequently credited with introducing the idea of contact lenses in his 1508 Codex of the eye, Manual D,[9] wherein he described a method of directly altering corneal power by either submerging the head in a bowl of water or wearing a water-filled glass hemisphere over the eye. Neither idea was practically implementable in da Vinci's time.[10]:9 He did not suggest his idea be used for correcting vision; he was more interested in exploring mechanisms of accommodation.[9]Descartes proposed a device for correcting vision consisting of a liquid-filled glass tube capped with a lens. However, the idea was impracticable, since the device was to be placed in direct contact with the cornea and thus would have made blinking impossible.[citation needed]In 1801, Thomas Young fashioned a pair of basic contact lenses based on Descartes' model. He used wax to affix water-filled lenses to his eyes, neutralizing their refractive power, which he corrected with another pair of lenses.[10] However his device was not intended to correct refraction errors.[citation needed]Sir John Herschel, in a footnote to the 1845 edition of the Encyclopedia Metropolitana, posed two ideas for the visual correction: the first \"a spherical capsule of glass filled with animal jelly\",[11] the second \"a mould of the cornea\" that could be impressed on \"some sort of transparent medium\".[12] Though Herschel reportedly never tested these ideas, they were later advanced by independent inventors, including Hungarian physician Joseph Dallos, who perfected a method of making molds from living eyes.[13] This enabled the manufacture of lenses that, for the first time, conformed to the actual shape of the eye.[citation needed]Although Louis J. Girard invented a scleral contact lens in 1887,[14] it was German ophthalmologist Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick who in 1888 fabricated the first successful afocal scleral contact lens.[15] Approximately 18â21 mm (0.71â0.83 in) in diameter, the heavy blown-glass shells rested on the less sensitive rim of tissue surrounding the cornea and floated on a dextrose solution. He experimented with fitting the lenses initially on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on a small group of volunteers, publishing his work, \"Contactbrille\", in the March 1888 edition of Archiv fÃ¼r Augenheilkunde.[citation needed] Large and unwieldy, Fick's lens could be worn only for a couple of hours at a time.[citation needed] August MÃ¼ller of Kiel, Germany, corrected his own severe myopia with a more convenient blown-glass scleral contact lens of his own manufacture in 1888.[16]The development of polymethyl methacrylate in the 1930s paved the way for the manufacture of plastic scleral lenses. In 1936, optometrist William Feinbloom introduced a hybrid lens composed of glass and plastic,[17] while in 1939, Hungarian optometrist Dr IstvÃ¡n GyÃ¶rffy produced the first fully plastic contact lens.[18] The following year, German optometrist Heinrich WÃ¶hlk produced his own version of plastic lenses based on experiments performed during the 1930s.[19]In 1949, the first \"corneal\" lenses were developed.[20][21][22][23] These were much smaller than the original scleral lenses, as they sat only on the cornea rather than across all of the visible ocular surface, and could be worn up to 16 hours a day. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) corneal lenses became the first contact lenses to have mass appeal through the 1960s, as lens designs became more sophisticated with improving manufacturing technology.[citation needed] On October 18, 1964, in a television studio in Washington, D.C., Lyndon Baines Johnson became the first President in the history of the United States to appear in public wearing contact lenses, under the supervision of Dr. Alan Isen, who developed the first commercially viable soft-contact lenses in the United states.[24][25][26]Early corneal lenses of the 1950s and 1960s were relatively expensive and fragile, resulting in the development of a market for contact lens insurance. Replacement Lens Insurance, Inc. (now known as RLI Corp.) phased out its original flagship product in 1994 after contact lenses became more affordable and easier to replace.[citation needed]One major disadvantage of PMMA lenses is that they allow no oxygen to get through to the conjunctiva and cornea, causing a number of adverse and potentially serious clinical effects. By the end of the 1970s and through the 1980s and 1990s, a range of oxygen-permeable but rigid materials were developed to overcome this problem. Chemist Norman Gaylord played a prominent role in the development of these new oxygen-permeable contact lenses.[27] Collectively, these polymers are referred to as rigid gas permeable or RGP materials or lenses. Though all the above contact lens typesâsclerals, PMMAs and RGPsâcould be correctly referred to as \"rigid\" or \"hard\", the latter term is now used to the original PMMAs, which are still occasionally fitted and worn, whereas \"rigid\" is a generic term for all these lens types; thus hard lenses (PMMAs) are a subset of rigid contact lenses. Occasionally, the term \"gas permeable\" is used to describe RGPs, which is somewhat misleading as soft contact lenses are also gas permeable in that they allow oxygen to get through to the ocular surface.The principal breakthrough in soft lenses was made by Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav LÃ­m, who published their work \"Hydrophilic gels for biological use\" in the journal Nature in 1959.[28] In 1965, National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch & Lomb, which started to manufacture them in the United States.[29] The Czech scientists' work led to the launch of the first soft (hydrogel) contact lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the first approval of the Soflens material by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort is achieved). Polymers from which soft lenses are manufactured improved over the next 25 years, primarily in terms of increasing oxygen permeability, by varying the ingredients. In 1972, British optometrist Rishi Agarwal was the first to suggest disposable soft contact lenses.[30][31]In 1998, the first silicone hydrogel contact lenses were released by Ciba Vision in Mexico. These new materials encapsulated the benefits of siliconeâwhich has extremely high oxygen permeabilityâwith the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels that had been used for the previous 30 years. These contact lenses were initially advocated primarily for extended (overnight) wear, although more recently, daily (no overnight) wear silicone hydrogels have been launched.In a slightly modified molecule, a polar group is added without changing the structure of the silicone hydrogel. This is referred to as the Tanaka monomer because it was invented and patented by Kyoichi Tanaka of Menicon Co. of Japan in 1979. Second-generation silicone hydrogels, such as galyfilcon A (Acuvue Advance, Vistakon) and senofilcon A (Acuvue Oasys, Vistakon), use the Tanaka monomer. Vistakon improved the Tanaka monomer even further and added other molecules, which serve as an internal wetting agent.[32]Comfilcon A (Biofinity, CooperVision) was the first third-generation polymer. Its patent claims that the material uses two siloxy macromers of different sizes that, when used in combination, produce very high oxygen permeability (for a given water content). Enfilcon A (Avaira, CooperVision) is another third-generation material that is naturally wettable; its water content is 46%.[32]Contact lenses are classified in many different ways: by their primary function, material, wear schedule (how long a lens can be worn), and replacement schedule (how long before a lens needs to be discarded).Corrective contact lenses are designed to improve vision, most commonly by correcting refractive error. This is done by directly focusing light so it enters the eye with the proper power for clear vision.A spherical contact lens bends light evenly in every direction (horizontally, vertically, etc.). They are typically used to correct myopia and hypermetropia. A toric contact lens has a different focusing power horizontally than vertically, and as a result can correct for astigmatism. Some spherical rigid lenses can also correct for astigmatism. Because a toric lens must have the proper orientation to correct for a person's astigmatism, such a lens must have additional design characteristics to prevent it from rotating away from the ideal alignment. This can be done by weighting the bottom of the lens or by using other physical characteristics to rotate the lens back into position. Some toric contact lenses have marks or etchings that can assist the eye doctor or the user in fitting the lens. The first disposable toric contact lenses were introduced in 2000 by Vistakon.Correction of presbyopia (a need for a reading prescription different from the prescription needed for distance) presents an additional challenge in the fitting of contact lenses. Two main strategies exist: multifocal lenses and monovision.Multifocal contact lenses (e.g. bifocals or progressives) are comparable to spectacles with bifocals or progressive lenses because they have multiple focal points. Multifocal contact lenses are typically designed for constant viewing through the center of the lens, but some designs do incorporate a shift in lens position to view through the reading power (similar to bifocal glasses).Monovision[33] is the use of single-vision lenses (one focal point per lens) to focus an eye (typically the dominant one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision.[34] Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.[35]Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses.For those with certain color deficiencies, a red-tinted \"X-Chrom\" contact lens may be used. Although such a lens does not restore normal color vision, it allows some color-blind people to distinguish colors better.[36][37] Red-filtering contact lenses can also be an option for extreme light sensitivity in some visual deficiencies such as achromatopsia.[38]ChromaGen contact lenses have been used and shown to have some limitations with vision at night although otherwise producing significant improvements in color vision.[39] An earlier study showed very significant improvements in color vision and patient satisfaction.[40]Later work that used these ChromaGen lenses with dyslexics in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial showed highly significant[clarification needed] improvements in reading ability over reading without the lenses.[41] This system has been granted FDA approval for use in the United States.[citation needed]Magnification is another area being researched for future contact lens applications.[42] Embedding of telescopic lenses and electronic components suggests that future uses of contact lenses may become extremely diverse.A cosmetic contact lens is designed to change the appearance of the eye. These lenses may also correct refractive error. Although many brands of contact lenses are lightly tinted to make them easier to handle, cosmetic lenses worn to change eye color are far less common, accounting for only 3% of contact lens fits in 2004.[43]In the United States, the FDA labels non-corrective cosmetic contact lenses as decorative contact lenses. Like any contact lens, cosmetic lenses carry risks of mild to serious complications, including ocular redness, irritation and infection.[44]Due to their medical nature, colored contact lenses, similar to regular ones, are illegal to purchase in the United States without a valid prescription. Those with perfect vision can buy color contacts for cosmetic reasons, but they still need their eyes to be measured for a \"plano\" prescription, meaning one with zero vision correction. This is for safety reasons so the lenses will fit the eye without causing irritation or redness.[45]Some colored contact lenses completely cover the iris, thus dramatically changing eye colour. Other colored contact lenses merely tint the iris, highlighting its natural colour.[46] A new trend in Japan, South Korea and China is the circle contact lens, which extend the appearance of the iris onto the sclera by having a dark tinted area all around. The result is an appearance of a bigger, wider iris, a look reminiscent of dolls' eyes.[47]One of the drawbacks of cosmetic lenses is not knowing how they will look before physically trying them on. This has led to an industry where lens retailers are heavily influenced by cutting edge digital fashion technology, specifically the Virtual Dressing Room technology. This technology offers users the option to upload a photo so they can virtually try on different lenses and experience how they will look before committing to a purchase. Examples of retailers that currently offer this technology are Freshlook Color Studios and Colorful Eyes.[48][49]Cosmetic lenses can have more direct medical applications. For example, some contact lenses can restore the appearance and, to some extent the function, of a damaged or missing iris.A scleral lens is a large, firm, transparent, oxygen-permeable contact lens that rests on the sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses may be used to improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, StevensâJohnson syndrome, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.[50]Soft lenses are often used in the treatment and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. A bandage contact lens allows the patient to see[51] while protecting an injured or diseased cornea[52] from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids, thereby allowing it to heal.[53] They are used in the treatment of conditions including bullous keratopathy, dry eyes, corneal abrasions and erosion, keratitis, corneal edema, descemetocele, corneal ectasis, Mooren's ulcer, anterior corneal dystrophy, and neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis.[54] Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed.[55]Glass lenses were never comfortable enough to gain widespread popularity. The first lenses to do so were those made from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA or Perspex/Plexiglas), now commonly referred to as \"hard\" lenses. Their main disadvantage is they do not allow oxygen to pass through to the cornea, which can cause a number of adverse, and often serious, clinical events. Starting in the late 1970s, improved rigid materials which were oxygen-permeable were developed. Contact lenses made from these materials are called rigid gas permeable lenses or 'RGPs'.A rigid lens is able to cover the natural shape of the cornea with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct corneal astigmatism. Rigid lenses can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. Rigid lenses can also correct corneas with irregular geometries, such as those with keratoconus or post surgical ectasias. In most cases, patients with keratoconus see better through rigid lenses than through glasses. Rigid lenses are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments than soft lenses.[citation needed]Soft lenses are more flexible than rigid lenses, and can be gently rolled or folded without damaging the lens. While rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before comfort is achieved, new soft lens wearers typically report lens awareness rather than pain or discomfort.Hydrogel lenses rely on their water content to transmit oxygen through the lens to the cornea. As a result, higher water content lenses allowed more oxygen to the cornea. In 1998, silicone hydrogel, or Si-hy lenses became available. These materials have both the extremely high oxygen permeability of silicone and the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels. Because silicone allows more oxygen permeability than water, oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogels is not tied to the lenses' water content. Lenses have now been developed with so much oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear (extended wear). Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials.[56]Disadvantages of silicone hydrogels are that they are slightly stiffer and the lens surface can be hydrophobic, thus less \"wettable\" â factors that can influence comfort of lens use. New manufacturing techniques and changes to multipurpose solutions have minimized these effects. A surface modification process called plasma coating alters the lens surface's hydrophobic nature. Another technique incorporates internal rewetting agents to make the lens surface hydrophilic. A third process uses longer backbone polymer chains that results in less cross linking and increased wetting without surface alterations or additive agents.Current brands of soft lenses are either traditional hydrogel or silicone hydrogel. Because of drastic differences in oxygen permeability, replacement schedule, and other design characteristics, it is very important to follow the instructions of the eye care professional prescribing the lenses.A small number of hybrid lenses exist. Typically these contact lenses consist of a rigid center and a soft \"skirt\". A similar technique is the \"piggybacking\" of a smaller, rigid lens on the surface of a larger, soft lens. These techniques are often chosen to give the vision correction benefits of a rigid lens and the comfort of a soft lens.[57]A \"daily wear\" (DW) contact lens is designed to be worn for one day and removed before sleeping. An \"extended wear\" (EW) contact lens is designed for continuous overnight wear, typically for up to 6 consecutive nights. Newer materials, such as silicone hydrogels, allow for even longer wear periods of up to 30 consecutive nights; these longer-wear lenses are often referred to as \"continuous wear\" (CW). EW and CW contact lenses can be worn overnight because of their high oxygen permeability. While awake, the eyes are mostly open, allowing oxygen from the air to dissolve into the tears and pass through the lens to the cornea. While asleep, oxygen is supplied from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid. A lens hindering passage of oxygen to the cornea causes corneal hypoxia which can result in serious complications, such as corneal ulcer that, if left untreated, can permanently decrease vision. EW and CW contact lenses typically allow for a transfer of 5â6 times more oxygen than conventional softs, allowing the cornea to remain healthy, even with closed eyelids.Wearing lenses designed for daily wear overnight has an increased risk for corneal infections, corneal ulcers and corneal neovascularizationâthis latter condition, once it sets in, cannot be reversed and will eventually spoil vision acuity through diminishing corneal transparency. The most common complication of extended wear is giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), sometimes associated with a poorly fitting contact lens.Contact lenses are often categorized by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because they do not have to stand up to the wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.Other disposable contact lenses are designed for replacement every two or four weeks. Quarterly or annual lenses, which used to be very common, are now much less so. Rigid gas permeable lenses are very durable and may last for several years without the need for replacement. PMMA hards were very durable and were commonly worn for 5 to 10 years, but had several drawbacks.Lenses with different replacement schedules can be made of the same material. Although the materials are alike, differences in the manufacturing processes determine if the resulting lens will be a \"daily disposable\" or one recommended for two or four week replacement. However, sometimes manufacturers use absolutely identical lenses and just repackage them with different labels.[58][59]Typically, soft contact lenses are mass-produced, while rigids are custom-made to exact specifications for the individual patient.Many companies make contact lenses. In the United States, there are five major manufacturers:[62]The parameters specified in a contact lens prescription may include:Prescriptions for contact lenses and glasses may be similar, but are not interchangeable. Prescribing of contact lenses is usually restricted to various combinations of ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians. An eye examination is needed to determine an individual's suitability for contact lens wear. This typically includes a refraction to determine the proper power of the lens and an assessment of the health of the eye's anterior segment. Many eye diseases prohibits contact lens wear, such as active infections, allergies, and dry eye.[63] Keratometry is especially important in the fitting of rigid lenses.Contact lenses are prescribed by ophthalmologists, optometrists, or specially licensed opticians under the supervision of an eye doctor. Contact lenses can typically be ordered at the office that conducts the eye exam and fitting. The Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act[64] gives consumers the right to obtain a copy of their contact lens prescription, allowing them to fill it at the lens provider of their choice.Contact lenses are generally safe as long as they are used correctly. Complications from contact lens wear affect roughly 5% of wearers yearly.[65] Factors leading to eye damage varies,[66] and improper use of a contact lens may affect the eyelid, the conjunctiva, and, most of all, the whole structure of the cornea.[65] Poor lens care can lead to infections by various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and Acanthamoeba (Acanthamoeba keratitis).Many complications arise when contact lenses are worn not as prescribed (improper wear schedule or lens replacement). Sleeping in lenses not designed or approved for extended wear is a common cause of complications. Many people go too long before replacing their contacts, wearing lenses designed for 1, 14, or 30 days of wear for multiple months or years. While this does save on the cost of lenses, it risks permanent damage to the eye and even loss of sight.One of the major factors that causes complications is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally gets that oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long-term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include corneal neovascularization, increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal edema, endothelial polymegethism, dry eye and potential increase in myopia.[67] That is why much of the research into the latest soft and rigid contact lens materials has centered on improving oxygen transmission through the lens.Mishandling of contact lenses can also cause problems. Corneal abrasions can increase the chances of infection.[68] When combined with improper cleaning and disinfection of the lens, a risk of infection further increases. Decreased corneal sensitivity after extended contact lens wear may cause a patient to miss some of the earliest symptoms of such complications.[69]The way contact lenses interact with the natural tear layer is a major factor in determining lens comfort and visual clarity. People suffering from dry eyes are particularly vulnerable to discomfort and episodes of brief blurry vision. Proper lens selection can minimize these effects.Long-term wear (over five years) of contact lenses may \"decrease the entire corneal thickness and increase the corneal curvature and surface irregularity.\"[70] Long-term wear of rigid contacts is associated with decreased corneal keratocyte density[71] and increased number of epithelial Langerhans cells.[72]All contact lenses sold in the United States are studied and approved as safe by the FDA when specific handling and care procedures, wear schedules, and replacement schedules are followed.Before touching the contact lens or the eye, it is important to wash hands thoroughly with soap and rinse well. Soaps containing moisturizers or allergens should be avoided as these can cause eye irritation.[73] Drying of hands using towels or tissues before handling contact lenses can transfer lint (fluff) to the hands and, subsequently, to the lenses, causing irritation upon insertion. Towels, unless freshly laundered on high temperature wash, are frequently contaminated with large quantities of bacteria and, as such, should be avoided when handling lenses. Dust, lint and other debris may collect on the outside of contact lenses. Again, hand contact with this material, before handling contact lenses, may transfer it to the lenses themselves. Rinsing the case under a source of clean running water, before opening it, can help alleviate this problem. Next the lens should be removed from its case and inspected for defects (e.g. splits, folds, lint). A 'gritty' or rough appearance to the lens surface may indicate that a considerable quantity of proteins, lipids and debris has built up on it and that additional cleaning is required; this is often accompanied and felt by unusually high irritation upon insertion.Make sure the soft lens is not inserted inside-out. Edge of a lens turned inside out has a different appearance, especially when the lens is slightly folded. Insertion of an inside-out lens for a brief time (less than one minute) should not cause any damage to the eye. Some brands of lenses have markings (e.g. numbers) on the rim that make it easier to tell the front of the lens from the back.The technique for removing or inserting a contact lens varies depending upon whether the lens is soft or rigid. There are many subtle variations to insertion and removal techniques. Because of differences in anatomy, manual dexterity, and visual limitations, every person must find the technique that works best for them. In all cases, the insertion and removal of lenses requires some training and practice on part of the user.Contact lenses are typically inserted into the eye by placing them on the pad of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may be placed on the sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes and then look towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.When the lens first contacts the eye, it should be comfortable. By making sure that particular attention is given to the eyelid margins for the presence of inflammation and signs of debris in the lashes, wearing contact lenses should be easy.[74] A brief period of irritation may occur, caused by a difference in pH and/or salinity between that of the lens solution and the tear.[75][76] This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, taking a break from lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the person should be seen as soon as possible by an eye doctor to rule out potentially serious complications.Removing contact lenses incorrectly can result in damage to the lens and injury to the eye, so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops out. With one finger on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral canthus, the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins against the edge of lens allows the blink to break the capillary action that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable.A soft contact lens may be removed by pinching the edge between the thumb and index finger. Moving the lens off the cornea first can improve comfort during removal and reduce risk of scratching the cornea with a fingernail. It is also possible to push or pull a soft lens far enough to the side or bottom of the eyeball to get it to fold then fall out, without pinching and thereby damaging it. If these techniques are used with a rigid lens, it may scratch the cornea.There are also small tools specifically for removing lenses. Usually made of flexible plastic, they resemble small tweezers, or plungers that suction onto the front of the lens. Typically, these tools are used only with rigid lenses. Extreme care must be exercised when using mechanical tools or fingernails to insert or remove contact lenses.Lens care varies depending on material and wear schedule. Daily disposables are discarded after a single use and thus require no cleaning. Other lenses need regular cleaning and disinfecting to prevent surface coating and infections.There are many ways to clean and care for contact lenses, typically called care systems or lens solutions:Aside from cleaning the contact lenses, it is highly advised to also clean the cases to avoid any possible infection. Replacing the case monthly, and storing it in a clean and safe environment is also recommended.[90]Contact lenses can be mechanically cleaned of more substantial protein, lipid and debris build up by rubbing them between the clean pad of a finger and the palm of a hand, using a small amount of cleaning fluid as a lubricant. However, this method does not sterilize the lenses and so should be performed only before a full sterilization cycle (e.g. when putting the contact lens away at night).Some products must be used only with certain types of contact lenses. Water alone will not at all disinfect the lens, and can lead to lens contamination causing potentially irreparable harm to the eye.Contact lens solutions often contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride and benzyl alcohol. Preservative-free products usually have shorter shelf lives, but are better suited for individuals with an allergy or sensitivity to a preservative. In the past, thiomersal was used as a preservative. In 1989, thiomersal was responsible for about 10% of problems related to contact lenses.[91] As a result, most products no longer contain thiomersal.Contact lens sensors to monitor the ocular temperature were recently demonstrated.[92] A large segment of current contact lens research is directed towards the treatment and prevention of conditions resulting from contact lens contamination and colonization by foreign organisms. Clinicians tend to agree that the most significant complication of contact lens wear is microbial keratitis and that the most predominant microbial pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa.[93] Other organisms are also major causative factors in bacterial keratitis associated with contact lens wear, although their prevalence varies across different locations. These include both the Staphylococcus species (aureus and epidermidis) and the Streptococcus species, among others.[94][95] Microbial keratitis is a serious focal point of current research due to its potentially devastating effect on the eye, including severe vision loss.[96]One specific research topic of interest is how microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated Pseudomonas binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response.[97] One way to alleviate hypoxia is to increase the amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility,[98] they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft contact lenses. A recent study showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermis adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone hydrogel contact lenses than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 20 times stronger than that of Staphylococcus epidermidis.[99] This might partly explain why Pseudomonas infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel contact lenses showed that worn silicone contact lenses were less prone to Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses.[100]Another important area of contact lens research deals with patient compliance. Compliance is a major issue[101] pertaining to the use of contact lenses because patient noncompliance often leads to contamination of the lens, storage case, or both.[102][103][104] However, careful users can extend the wear of lenses through proper handling: there is, unfortunately, no disinterested research on the issue of \"compliance\" or the length of time a user can safely wear a lens beyond its stated use. The introduction of multipurpose solutions and daily disposable lenses have helped to alleviate some of the problems observed from inadequate cleaning but new methods of combating microbial contamination are currently being developed. A silver-impregnated lens case has been developed which helps to eradicate any potentially contaminating microbes that come in contact with the lens case.[105] Additionally, a number of antimicrobial agents are being developed that have been embedded into contact lenses themselves. Lenses with covalently attached selenium molecules have been shown to reduce bacterial colonization without adversely affecting the cornea of a rabbit eye[106] and octyl glucoside used as a lens surfactant significantly decreases bacterial adhesion.[107] These compounds are of particular interest to contact lens manufacturers and prescribing optometrists because they do not require any patient compliance to effectively attenuate the effects of bacterial colonization.A recent area of research is in the field of bionic lenses. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and light-emitting diodes and can harvest radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can display information beamed from a mobile device overcoming the small display size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses will also need to have an array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearerâs eyes. The lens could also serve as a head-up display for pilots or gamers.[108]Drug administration through contact lenses is also becoming an area of research. One application is a lens that releases anesthesia to the eye for post-surgery pain relief, especially after PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) in which the healing process takes several days. One experiment shows that silicone contact lenses that contain vitamin E deliver pain medication for up to seven days compared with less than two hours in usual lenses.[108]Another study of the usage of contact lens is aimed to address the issue of macular degeneration (AMD or age-related macular degeneration). An international collaboration of researchers was able to develop a contact lens that can shift between magnified and normal vision. Previous solutions to AMD included bulky glasses or surgical implants. But the development this new contact lens, which is made of polymethyl methacrylate, could offer an unobtrusive solution.[109]One of the earliest known motion pictures to introduce the use of contact lenses as a make-up artist's device for enhancing the eyes was by the innovative actor Lon Chaney in the 1926 film The Road to Mandalay to create the effect of a character who had a blind eye.[110] Dr. Rueben Greenspoon applied them to Orson Welles for the film Citizen Kane in 1940. In the 1950s, contact lenses were starting to be used in British color horror films. An early example of this is the British actor Christopher Lee as the Dracula character in the 1958 color horror film Dracula, which helped to emphasize his horrific looking black pupils and red bloodshot eyes. Tony Curtis wore them in the 1968 film The Boston Strangler. Contact lenses were also used to better emphasize the sinister gaze of the demonic characters in 1968's Rosemary's Baby and 1973's The Exorcist. Colored custom-made contact lenses are now standard makeup for a number of special effects-based movies.[111]"

        "name": "Daydream View",
        "text": "Daydream is a virtual reality (VR) platform developed by Google primarily for use with a head mount for a smartphone. It is available for select phones running the Android mobile operating system (versions \"Nougat\" 7.1 and later)[1][2] that meet the platform's software and hardware requirements. Daydream was announced at the Google I/O developer conference in May 2016,[1][2] and the first headset, the Daydream View, was released on November 10, 2016.[3] To use the platform, users place their phone into the back of a viewer, run Daydream-compatible mobile apps, and view content through the viewer's lenses. A standalone headset with integrated hardware, the Lenovo Mirage Solo, does not require a phone to use.Daydream is Google's second foray into VR following Cardboard, a low-cost platform intended to encourage interest in VR. Compared to Cardboard, which was built into compatible apps and offered limited features, Daydream was built into Android itself and included enhanced features, including support for controllers. Daydream was not widely adopted by consumers or developers, and in October 2019, Google announced that the Daydream View headset had been discontinued and that they would no longer certify new devices for Daydream.[4]In May 2016 at the Google I/O developer conference, Google announced that a new virtual reality (VR) platform called \"Daydream\" would be built into their next Android release, Nougat.[1][2]Daydream allows users to interact with VR-enabled apps, including YouTube, Google Maps Street View, Google Play Movies & TV, and Google Photos in an immersive view. Google recruited media companies like Netflix and Ubisoft for entertainment apps.[1][2]In January 2017, Google opened the Daydream program for all third-party developers.[5][6]The first-generation Google Daydream View was announced on October 4, 2016.[7][8][9] Daydream-ready smartphones can be placed in the front compartment of the Daydream View and then viewed in VR through the headset's two lenses. The View distinguished itself from previous VR head mounts by being constructed out of a light-weight cloth material, as well as featuring capacitive nubs and an NFC chip to simplify the process of setting up virtual reality viewing.[10]The Daydream View was released on November 10, 2016.[3][11]The Daydream View launched in a \"Slate\" color option. Two new color choices, \"Crimson\" and \"Snow\", became available on December 8, 2016.[12]In a review of the Google Daydream View, Adi Robertson of The Verge wrote that the headset was the \"best mobile headset\" she'd ever used, complimenting its \"squishy foam-and-fabric body\" being \"significantly smaller, lighter, and more portable than the Samsung Gear VR\", and that its design \"keeps the lenses relatively protected during travel\". She also liked the device's weight distribution, writing that it \"rests more weight on your forehead than your cheeks, an option I've found more comfortable\" and that allows her to \"wear it easily for hours at a time\". She also praised the material, particularly its plastic sliders rather than velcro patches on the head strap, writing that it allows \"a wider range of sizes and avoids gathering lint\", and that the View's overall design \"could almost pass for an airplane sleep mask\", meaning that it \"avoids looking ostentatiously high-tech or intimidating\".[13]Google Daydream headsets are packaged with a wireless controller. This controller can be used for interacting with the virtual world through button presses or through waving the device. On-board sensors are used to track the orientation of the controller and approximate the position of the user's hand. The Daydream View's controller can be stored inside the headset while not in use.[9] The controller has a touch pad, two circular buttons (one functioning as a home button and one functioning as an app-specific button), and two volume buttons, along with a status light. The controller is rechargeable and charges via USB-C. On its support pages, Google notes that the Daydream View \"doesn't include a charger or cables\" and instead directs users to purchase those from the Google Store.[14]The second-generation Daydream View was unveiled during the Made by Google 2017 event. For the first time, it is available in three colors, namely: \"Charcoal\", \"Fog\", and \"Coral\". It is largely similar to the first-generation, with a few improvements, including a slightly altered design and improved lenses for a wider field of view. On the other hand, Augmented Reality is a major upgrade exclusive to the second-generation's design. It was released on 19 October 2017 with a launch price of US$99.[15][16][17]Lenovo's Mirage Solo headset, announced at CES 2018, is the first standalone headset running on Google's Daydream platform. It is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip, has 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage expandable by microSD, dual mics, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a 2560 x 1440 LCD screen and a 4,000 mAh battery. Its highlight feature is support for Google \"WorldSense\", an improved position tracking technology.[18]The headset is designed to be coupled with the Mirage Camera, which is a point-and shoot 180-degree 3D VR camera with two lenses that can capture in 4K.[19]Lenovo released the device in May 2018, with a price of $399.[20]Daydream will only work on certain newer phones with specific components. Google announced at the Google I/O conference in May 2016 that eight hardware partners would make Daydream-ready phones: Samsung, HTC, LG, Xiaomi, Huawei, ZTE, Asus and Alcatel.[21] Phones dedicate processing power to the Daydream mode in order to reduce latency and prevent nausea.[2] Google CEO Sundar Pichai expected 11 Android smartphones supporting Daydream VR to be on sale by the end of 2017.[22]In 2019, HBO discontinued its Daydream apps, while Hulu dropped support for the platform from its app.[35] The Google Play Movies app for Daydream, which was developed and maintained by Google, was discontinued in June 2019.[36]On October 15, 2019, Google announced that it would no longer sell the Daydream View headset,[37] and that their new flagship phones, the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, would not be certified for Daydream.[4] No phones released in 2019 are compatible with Daydream,[35] and the company confirmed that no additional devices would be certified for the platform.[4] A spokesperson said, \"There hasn't been the broad consumer or developer adoption we had hoped, and we've seen decreasing usage over time of the Daydream View headset.\" The representative said that the company recognized the potential in smartphone VR but: \"we noticed some clear limitations constraining smartphone VR from being a viable long-term solution. Most notably, asking people to put their phone in a headset and lose access to the apps they use throughout the day causes immense friction.\" Google confirmed that the Daydream app and app store would remain available.[35]"

        "name": "Docs",
        "text": "Google Docs is a word processor included as part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by Google within its Google Drive service. This service also includes Google Sheets and Google Slides, a spreadsheet and presentation program respectively. Google Docs is available as a web application, mobile app for Android, iOS, Windows, BlackBerry, and as a desktop application on Google's ChromeOS. The app is compatible with Microsoft Office file formats.[2] The application allows users to create and edit files online while collaborating with other users in real-time. Edits are tracked by user with a revision history presenting changes. An editor's position is highlighted with an editor-specific color and cursor. A permissions system regulates what users can do. Updates have introduced features using machine learning, including \"Explore\", offering search results based on the contents of a document, and \"Action items\", allowing users to assign tasks to other users.Google Docs originated from two separate products: Writely and XL2Web. Writely was a web-based word processor created by the software company Upstartle and launched in August 2005.[3] It began as an experiment by programmers Sam Schillace, Steve Newman and Claudia Carpenter, trying out the then-new Ajax technology and the \"content editable\" function in browsers.[4] On March 9, 2006, Google announced that it had acquired Upstartle.[5][6] In July 2009, Google dropped the beta testing status from Google Docs.[7] In March 2010, Google acquired DocVerse, an online document collaboration company. DocVerse allowed multiple user online collaboration on Microsoft Word documents, as well as other Microsoft Office formats, such as Excel and PowerPoint.[8] Improvements based on DocVerse were announced and deployed in April 2010.[9] In June 2012, Google acquired Quickoffice, a freeware proprietary productivity suite for mobile devices.[10] In October 2012, Google renamed the Drive products and Google Documents became Google Docs. At the same time, Chrome apps were released, which provided shortcuts to the service on Chrome's new tab page.[11] In February 2019, Google announced grammar suggestions in Docs, expanding their spell check by using machine translation techniques to help catch tricky grammatical errors.[12]Google Docs is available as a web application supported on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari web browsers.[13] Users can access all Docs, as well as other files, collectively through the Google Drive website. In June 2014, Google rolled out a dedicated website homepage for Docs, that contains only files created with the service.[14] In 2014, Google launched a dedicated mobile app for Docs on the Android and iOS mobile operating systems.[15][16][17] In 2015, the mobile website for Docs was updated with a \"simpler, more uniform\" interface, and while users can read files through the mobile websites, users trying to edit will be redirected towards the dedicated mobile app, thus preventing editing on the mobile web.[18]Google Docs and the other apps in the Google Drive suite serve as a collaborative tool for cooperative editing of documents in real-time. Documents can be shared, opened, and edited by multiple users simultaneously and users are able to see character-by-character changes as other collaborators make edits. Changes are automatically saved to Google's servers, and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed and reverted to.[20] An editor's current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing that part of the document they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows collaborators to discuss edits. The revision history allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color. Only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. Files can be exported to a user's local computer in a variety of formats (ODF, HTML, PDF, RTF, Text, Office Open XML). Files can be tagged and archived for organizational purposes.In March 2014, Google introduced add-ons; new tools from third-party developers that add more features for Google Docs.[21] In order to view and edit documents offline on a computer, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser. A Chrome extension, Google Docs Offline, allows users to enable offline support for Docs files on the Google Drive website.[22] The Android and iOS apps natively support offline editing.[23][24]4In June 2014, Google introduced \"Suggested edits\" in Google Docs; as part of the \"commenting access\" permission, participants can come up with suggestions for edits that the author can accept or reject, in contrast to full editing ability.[16] In October 2016, Google announced \"Action items\" for Docs. If a user writes phrases such as \"Ryan to follow up on the keynote script\", the service will intelligently assign that action to \"Ryan\". Google states this will make it easier for other collaborators to see which person is responsible for what task. When a user visits Google Drive, Docs, Sheets or Slides, any files with tasks assigned to them will be highlighted with a badge.[25]A basic research tool was introduced in 2012, later expanded into \"Explore\",[26][27][28] launched in September 2016, enabling additional functionality through machine learning.[29][30][31] In Google Docs, Explore shows relevant Google search results based on information in the document, simplifying information gathering. Users can also mark specific document text, press Explore and see search results based on the marked text only.In December 2016, Google introduced a quick citations feature to Google Docs. The quick citation tool allows users to \"insert citations as footnotes with the click of a button\" on the web through the Explore feature introduced in September. The citation feature also marked the launch of the Explore functionalities in G Suite for Education accounts.[32][33][34]Files in the following formats can be viewed and converted to the Docs format:[35]Limits to insertable file sizes, overall document length and size are listed below:[36][37]Google Docs and the Drive suite are free of charge for use by individuals, but are also available as part of Google's business-centered G Suite, enabling additional business-focused functionality on payment of a monthly subscription.[38]A simple find and replace tool is available. The Drive suite includes a web clipboard tool that allows users to copy and paste content between Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides and Drawings. The web clipboard can also be used for copying and pasting content between different computers. Copied items are stored on Google's servers for up to 30 days. For most copying and pasting, Google Docs also supports keyboard shortcuts.[39] Google offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called Office editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides that enables users to view and edit Microsoft Word documents on Google Chrome, via the Docs app. The extension can be used for opening Office files stored on the computer using Chrome, as well as for opening Office files encountered on the web (in the form of email attachments, web search results, etc.) without having to download them. The extension is installed on Chrome OS by default.[40] Google Cloud Connect was a plug-in for Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and 2010 that could automatically store and synchronize any Word document to Google Docs (before the introduction of Drive) in Google Docs or Microsoft Office formats. The online copy was automatically updated each time the Microsoft Word document was saved. Microsoft Word documents could be edited offline and synchronized later when online. Google Cloud Connect maintained previous Microsoft Word document versions and allowed multiple users to collaborate by working on the same document at the same time.[41][42] Google Cloud Connect was discontinued in April 2013 as, according to Google, Google Drive achieves all of the above tasks, \"with better results\".[43]In a December 2016 review of Google Docs and the Drive software suite, Edward Mendelsohn of PC Magazine wrote that the suite was \"visually elegant\" with \"effortless collaboration\", but that Docs, as paired with Sheets and Slides, was \"less powerful than desktop-based suites\". Comparing Google's office suite with Microsoft's and Apple's, he stated that \"Docs exists only in your Web browser\", meaning that users have \"more limited feature set\" than \"the spacious, high-powered setting of a desktop app\". He wrote that offline support required a plug-in, describing it as \"less convenient than a desktop app, and you have to remember to install it before you need it\". Mendelsohn praised the user interface, describing it as \"elegant, highly usable\" with \"fast performance\", and that the revision history \"alerts you to recent changes, and stores fine-grained records of revisions\". Regarding the Explore functionality, he credited it for being the \"niftiest new feature\" in the suite and that it surpassed comparable features in Microsoft Office. He described the quality of imports of Word files as \"impressive fidelity\". He summarized by praised Docs and the Drive suite for having \"the best balance of speed and power, and the best collaboration features, too\", while noting that \"it lacks a few features offered by Microsoft Office 365, but it was also faster to load and save in our testing\".[44]In May 2017, a phishing attack impersonating a Google Docs sharing email spread on the Internet. The attack sent emails pretending to be someone the target knew, requesting to share a document with them. Once the link in the email was pressed, users were directed to a real Google account permissions page where the phishing software, a third-party app named \"Google Docs\", requested access to the user's Google account. Once granted, the software received access to the user's Gmail messages and address book, and sent new fraudulent document invitations to their contacts.[45] The phishing attack was described by media outlets as \"massive\"[46] and \"widespread\",[47] and The Next Web's Napier Lopez wrote that it's \"very easy to fall for\".[46] One of the reasons the attack was so effective was that its email messages passed through spam and security software, and used a real Google address.[48] Within hours, the attack was stopped and fixed by Google, with a spokesperson stating that \"We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again\".[49][50] On the same day, Google updated Gmail on Android to feature protection from phishing attacks.[51][52][53] Media outlets noticed that, while the added protection was announced on the same day as the attack, it \"may not have prevented this week's attack, however, as that attack involved a malicious and fake \"Google Docs\" app that was hosted on Google's own domain\".[53] In early May 2017, Ars Technica reported that \"at least three security researchers\" had raised issues about the threat, one of them in October 2011, and that the attacker or attackers behind the actual incident \"may have copied the technique from a proof of concept posted by one security researcher to GitHub in February\". Furthermore, the report noted that Google had been repeatedly warned by researchers about the potential threat, with security researcher Greg Carson telling Ars Technica that \"I don't think Google fully understood how severely this could be abused, but certainly hackers did\".[54]In October 2017, Google released a server-side update to its codebase, which started incorrectly flagging random documents as unspecified violations of its \"Terms of Service\" policies. A fix was released shortly afterwards,[55][56] though the issue became noteworthy for the extent of Google's control over users' content, including its analysis of the contents of documents, as well as for its ability to shut users out at any time, including during critical moments of work.[57][58][59]"

        "text": "Google Drawings is a free, web-based diagramming software developed by Google. It allows users to collaborate and work together in real time to create flowcharts, organisational charts, website wireframes, mind maps, concept maps, and other types of diagrams. Google Drawings is also available as a Chrome app that works offline, available from the Chrome Web Store.[1] Google Drawings is hosted within Google Drive and all files created with the application are by default saved to Google Drive. It was originally introduced on April 12, 2010 as Google Docs drawings, a tool for making drawings in Google Docs.[2]Google Drawings allows multiple users to open and edit drawings simultaneously in real time. It contains a subset of the features in Google Slides but with different templates.[clarification needed] Users can insert images from the local hard drive or from the Web, as well as shapes, arrows, scribbles and text. Google Drawings has set of flow-chart symbols and other shapes that can be dragged and dropped into place. Users can move, resize and rotate objects, and use polylines and line connectors. It also allows for the editing of images, including cropping, applying masks and adding borders.[3] Other features include laying out drawings precisely with alignment guides, snapping to grid, and auto-distribution. Drawings can be inserted into other Google documents, spreadsheets, or presentations. They can also be published online as images or downloaded in standard formats such as JPEG, SVG, PNG, or PDF.[4][5][6][7]"

        "name": "Drive",
        "text": "Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google. Launched on April 24, 2012, Google Drive allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and share files. In addition to a website, Google Drive offers apps with offline capabilities for Windows and macOS computers, and Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. Google Drive encompasses Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides, which are a part of an office suite that permits collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more. Files created and edited through the office suite are saved in Google Drive.Google Drive offers users 15 gigabytes of free storage through Google One. Google One also offers 100 gigabytes, 200 gigabytes, 2 terabytes, 10 terabytes, 20 terabytes, and 30 terabytes offered through optional paid plans. Files uploaded can be up to 5 terabytes in size. Users can change privacy settings for individual files and folders, including enabling sharing with other users or making content public. On the website, users can search for an image by describing its visuals, and use natural language to find specific files, such as \"find my budget spreadsheet from last December\".The website and Android app offer a Backups section to see what Android devices have data backed up to the service, and a completely overhauled computer app released in July 2017 allows for backing up specific folders on the user's computer. A Quick Access feature can intelligently predict the files users need.Google Drive is a key component of G Suite, Google's monthly subscription offering for businesses and organizations. As part of select G Suite plans, Drive offers unlimited storage, advanced file audit reporting, enhanced administration controls, and greater collaboration tools for teams.Following the launch of the service, Google Drive privacy policy was heavily criticized by some members of the media. Google has one set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements that cover all of its services, meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce, use, and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive. While the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights, privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant Google the rights to use the information and data to customize advertising and other services Google provides. In contrast, other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud storage services, but that the competition uses \"more artful language\" in the agreements, and also stated that Google needs the rights in order to \"move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails\".As of March 2017, Google Drive has 800 million active users, and as of September 2015, it has over one million organizational paying users. As of May 2017, there are over two trillion files stored on the service.Google Drive was introduced on April 24, 2012 with apps available for Windows, macOS, and Android, as well as a website interface.[4] The iOS app was released in June 2012.[5]Google Drive is available for PCs running Windows 7 or later, and Macs running OS X Lion or later.[6] Google indicated in April 2012 that work on Linux software was underway,[7] but there was no news on this as of November 2013.[8] In April 2012, Google's then-Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai said that Google Drive would be tightly integrated with Chrome OS version 20.[9] In October 2016, Google announced that, going forward, it would drop support for versions of the computer software older than 1 year.[10] In June 2017, Google announced that a new app called Backup and Sync would replace the existing separate Google Drive and Google Photos desktop apps, creating one unified app on desktop platforms.[11][12] Originally intended for release on June 28, its release was delayed[13] until July 12.[14][15][16] In September 2017, Google announced that it would discontinue the Google Drive desktop app in March 2018 and end support in December 2017.[17]In July 2017, Google announced their new downloadable software, Backup and Sync.[18] It was made mainly to replace the Google Drive desktop app,[19] which was discontinued.[17] Its main function is for the user to be able to set certain folders to constantly sync onto their Google account's Drive. The synced folders and files count against the shared quota allocated between Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Drive.Google Drive is available for Android smartphones and tablets running Android 4.1 \"Jelly Bean\" or later,[20] and iPhones and iPads running iOS 8 or later.[21]In August 2016, Google Drive ended support for Android devices running Android 4.0 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" or older versions,[22] citing Google's mobile app update policy, which states: \"For Android devices, we provide updates for the current and 2 previous Android versions.\" According to the policy, the app will continue to work for devices running older Android versions, but any app updates are provided on a best-efforts basis. The policy also states a notice will be given for any planned end of service.[23]Google Drive has a website that allows users to see their files from any Internet-connected computer, without the need to download an app.The website received a visual overhaul in 2014 that gave it a completely new look and improved performance. It also simplified some of the most common tasks, such as clicking only once on a file to see recent activity or share the file, and added drag-and-drop functionality, where users can simply drag selected files to folders, for improved organization.[24][25]A new update in August 2016 changed several visual elements of the website; the logo was updated, the search box design was refreshed, and the primary color was changed from red to blue. It also improved the functionality to download files locally from the website; users can now compress and download large Drive items into multiple 2 GB .zip files with an improved naming structure, better Google Forms handling, and empty folders are now included in the .zip, thereby preserving the user's folder hierarchy.[26][27]Google gives every user 15 GB of free storage though Google One, Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides files do not count towards the storage limit.[28] This cloud storage is also shared with Gmail and Google Photos.[29] An unlimited number of photos at maximum 16 megapixels and videos at maximum 1080p resolutions are stored for free using the \"High quality\" setting in Google Photos. Using the \"Original quality\" setting uses Google Drive quota.[30]Users can purchase additional space through either a monthly or yearly payment. The option of yearly payments was introduced in December 2016, and is limited to the 100 GB, 200 GB or 2 TB storage plans.[28] Furthermore, the yearly payments offer a discount.[31] In May 2018, Google announced that storage plans (including the free 15 gigabyte plan) would be moved over to Google One.[32]As of 2017, these are the storage plans offered by Google:[28]Chromebook users can obtain 100 GB of Google Drive storage free for 2 years as long as the promotion is activated within 180 days of the Chromebook device's initial purchase.[33] This is available in all countries where Google Drive is available. Offer can only be redeemed once per device. Used, open-box, and refurbished devices are not eligible for the offer.Google offers 30 GB of Drive storage for all G Suite Basic customers, and unlimited storage for those using G Suite Business or G Suite for Education, as long as there are at least 5 members. Associations with less than 5 members get 1 TB per user.[34]Before the introduction of Google Drive, Google Docs initially provided 15 GB of storage free of charge.[citation needed] On April 24, 2012, Google Drive was introduced with free storage of 5 GB. Storage plans were revised, with 25GB costing $2.49/month, 100GB costing $4.99/month and 1TB costing $49.99/month.[4]Originally, Gmail, Google Docs and Picasa had separate allowances for free storage and a shared allowance for purchased storage.[35] Between April 2012 and May 2013, Google Drive and Google+ Photos had a shared allowance for both free and purchased storage, whereas Gmail had a separate 10 GB storage limit, which increased to 25 GB on the purchase of any storage plan.[36]In September 2012, Google announced that a paid plan would now cover total storage, rather than the paid allocation being added to the free; e.g. a 100 GB plan allowed a total of 100 GB rather than 115 GB as previously.[37]In May 2013, Google announced the overall merge of storage across Gmail, Google Drive and Google+ Photos, giving users 15 GB of unified free storage between the services.[38]In March 2014, the storage plans were revised again and prices were reduced by 80% to $1.99/month for 100 GB, $9.99/month for 1TB, and $99.99/month for 10 TB.[39] This was much cheaper than competitors Dropbox and OneDrive offered at the time.[40]In 2018, the paid plans were re-branded as Google One to emphasize their application beyond Google Drive, along with the addition of a $2.99/month plan for 200 GB, and increasing the $9.99 plan to 2 TB at no additional charge.[41]In most cases during these changes, users could continue with their existing plans as long as they kept their accounts active and did not make any adjustments to the plan. However, if the account lapsed for any reason, users had to choose from current plans.Google Drive incorporates a system of file sharing in which the creator of a file or folder is, by default, its owner. The owner can regulate the public visibility of the file or folder. Ownership is transferable. Files or folders can be shared privately with particular users having a Google account, using their @gmail.com email addresses. Sharing files with users not having a Google account requires making them accessible to \"anybody with the link\". This generates a secret URL for the file, which may be shared via email or private messages. Files and folders can also be made \"public on the web\", which means that they can be indexed by search engines and thus can be found and accessed by anyone. The owner may also set an access level for regulating permissions. The three access levels offered are \"can edit\", \"can comment\" and \"can view\". Users with editing access can invite others to edit.A number of external web applications that work with Google Drive are available from the Chrome Web Store. To add an app, users are required to sign into the Chrome Web Store, but the apps are compatible with all supported web browsers. Some of these apps are first-party, such as Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Drive apps operate on the online files, and can be used to view, edit and create files in various formats, edit images and videos, fax and sign documents, manage projects, create flowcharts, etc. Drive apps can also be made the default for handling file formats supported by them. Some of these apps also work offline on Google Chrome and Chrome OS.[42][43]All of the third-party apps are free to install. However, some have fees associated with continued usage or access to additional features. Saving data from a third-party app to Google Drive requires authorization the first time.[44]The Google Drive software development kit (SDK) works together with the Google Drive user interface and the Chrome Web Store to create an ecosystem of apps that can be installed into Google Drive. In February 2013, the \"Create\" menu in Google Drive was revamped to include third-party apps, thus effectively granting them the same status as Google's own apps.[45][46]In March 2013, Google released an API for Google Drive that enables third-party developers to build collaborative apps that support real-time editing.[47][48]The Google Drive viewer on the web allows the following file formats to be viewed:[49]Files in other formats can also be handled through third-party apps that work with Google Drive, available from the Chrome Web Store.[42]Files that are uploaded, but not converted to Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides formats, may be up to 5 TB in size. There are also limits, specific to file type, listed below:[49][50]Introduced in the Android app in September 2016, Quick Access uses machine learning to \"intelligently predict the files you need before you've even typed anything\".[51][52] The feature was announced to be expanded to iOS and the web in March 2017,[53] though the website interface received the feature in May.[54]Search results can be narrowed by file type, ownership, visibility, and the open-with app. Users can search for images by describing or naming what is in them. For example, a search for \"mountain\" returns all the photos of mountains, as well as any text documents about mountains.[55] Text in images and PDFs can be extracted using optical character recognition.[56] In September 2016, Google added \"natural language processing\" for searching on the Google Drive website, enabling specific user search queries like \"find my budget spreadsheet from last December\".[57] In February 2017, Google integrated Drive and the Google Search app on Android, letting users search for keywords, switch to an \"In Apps\" tab, and see any relevant Drive files.[58][59][60]In December 2016, Google updated the Android app and website with a \"Backups\" section, listing the Android device and app backups saved to Drive. The section lets users see what backups are stored, the backups' sizes and details, and delete backups.[61]In June 2017, Google announced that a new app, \"Backup and Sync\", would be able to synchronize any folder on the user's computer to Google.[11][12] The app was released on July 12, 2017.[14][15][16]A Description field is available for both files and folders that users can use to add relevant metadata. Content within the Description field is also indexed by Google Drive and searchable.[62]In June 2014, Google announced a number of updates to Google Drive, which included making the service more accessible to visually impaired users. This included improved keyboard accessibility, support for zooming and high contrast mode, and better compatibility with screen readers.[24]Google offers an extension for Google Chrome, Save to Google Drive, that allows users to save web content to Google Drive through a browser action or through the context menu. While documents and images can be saved directly, webpages can be saved in the form of a screenshot (as an image of the visible part of the page or the entire page), or as a raw HTML, MHTML, or Google Docs file. Users need to be signed into Chrome to use the extension.[63]The main Google Drive mobile app supported editing of documents and spreadsheets until April 2014, when the capability was moved to separate, standalone apps for Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides.[64][65] The Google Drive app on Android allows users to take a photo of a document, sign, or other text and use optical character recognition to convert to text that can be edited.[66] In October 2014, the Android app was updated with a Material Design user interface, improved search, the ability to add a custom message while sharing a file, and a new PDF viewer.[67][68]Before 2013, Google did not encrypt data stored on its servers. Following information that the United States' National Security Agency had \"direct access\" to servers owned by multiple technology companies, including Google,[69] the company began testing encrypting data in July[70] and enabled encryption for data in transit between its data centers in November.[71] However, as of 2015, Google Drive does not provide client-side encryption.[72]Google Drive for Work was a business version, as part of G Suite (formerly Google Apps for Work), announced at the Google I/O conference on June 25, 2014 and made available immediately. The service features unlimited storage, advanced file audit reporting and eDiscovery services, along with enhanced administration control and new APIs specifically useful to businesses. Users can upload files as large as 5 TB.[73] A press release posted on Google's Official Enterprise Blog assured businesses that Google would encrypt data stored on its servers, as well as information being transmitted to or from them. Google delivers 24/7 phone support to business users and has guaranteed 99.9% uptime for its servers.[74]In September 2015, Google announced that Google Drive for Work would be compliant with the new ISO/IEC 27018:2014 security and privacy standard, which confirmed that Google would not use data in Drive for Work accounts for advertising, enabled additional tools for handling and exporting data, more transparency about data storage, and protection from third-party data requests.[75]In March 2017, Google introduced Drive File Stream, making it possible for G Suite customers on Windows and macOS computers to search their Drive folders and download specific files on-demand rather than downloading all files during installation, potentially preventing large amounts of data from \"gobbling up your hard drive\". Additionally, the feature guesses what files users need in the future and downloads those files as well.[76][77]In July 2018, Google announced a new version, called Drive Enterprise, for businesses that don't want to buy the full G Suite.[78] Drive Enterprise includes Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides which permits collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and other file types. Drive Enterprise also allows users to access and collaborate on Microsoft Office files and 60+ other file types.[49] The pricing of Drive Enterprise is based on usage, with $8 per active user per month, plus $0.04 per GB per month.Google Drive for Education was announced on September 30, 2014. It was made available for free to all Google Apps for Education users. It includes unlimited storage and support for individual files up to 5TB in size in addition to full encryption.[79]In September 2016, Google announced Team Drives, a new way for teams to collaborate. Sharing and file ownership are managed for the entire team rather than one individual, and new users instantly get access to all files and information.[80] In November, Google opened an Early Adopter Program, allowing G Suite Business and G Suite for Education customers to sign up, although Google noted that some functionality isn't yet supported by Team Drives.[81]Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, and Google Forms constitute a free, web-based office suite offered by Google and integrated with Google Drive. It allows users to create and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations online while collaborating in real-time with other users. The three apps are available as web applications, as Chrome apps that work offline, and as mobile apps for Android and iOS. The apps are compatible with Microsoft Office file formats. The suite also consists of Google Forms, Google Drawings and Google Fusion Tables. While Forms and Tables are only available as web applications, Drawings is also available as a Chrome app. The suite is tightly integrated with Google Drive, and all files created with the apps are by default saved to Google Drive.Updates to Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms have introduced features using machine learning, including \"Explore\", offering search results based on the contents of a document, answers based on natural language questions in a spreadsheet, and dynamic design suggestions based on contents of a slideshow, and \"Action items\", allowing users to assign tasks to other users. While Google Docs has been criticized for lacking the functionality of Microsoft Office, it has received praise for its simplicity, ease of collaboration and frequent product updates.In order to view and edit Docs, Sheets, or Slides documents offline, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser. A Chrome extension, Google Docs Offline, allows users to enable offline support for Docs, Sheets and Slides files on the Google Drive website.[82]Google also offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called Office editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides that enables users to view and edit Microsoft Office documents on Google Chrome, via the Docs, Sheets and Slides apps. The extension can be used for opening Office files stored on the computer using Chrome, as well as for opening Office files encountered on the web (in the form of email attachments, web search results, etc.) without having to download them. The extension is installed on Chrome OS by default.[83]Google Drawings allows users to collaborate creating, sharing, and editing images or drawings. Google Drawings can be used for creating charts, diagrams, designs, flow-charts, etc. It contains a subset of the features in Google Slides but with different templates. Its features include laying out drawings precisely with alignment guides, snap to grid, auto distribution, and inserting drawings into other Google documents, spreadsheets, or presentations.[84]In a review of Google Drive after its launch in April 2012, Dan Grabham of TechRadar wrote that the integration of Google Docs into Google Drive was \"a bit confusing\", mainly due to the differences in the user interfaces between the two, where Drive offers a \"My Drive\" section with a specific \"Shared with me\" view for shared documents. He stated that \"We think the user interface needs a lot more work. It's like a retread of Google Docs at the moment and Google surely needs to do work here\". He considered uploading files \"fairly easy\", but noted that folder upload was only supported through the Google Chrome web browser. The lack of native editing of Microsoft Office documents was \"annoying\". Regarding Google Drive's computer apps, he stated that the option in Settings to synchronize only specific folders was \"powerful\". He wrote that Drive was \"a great addition to Google armoury of apps and everything does work seamlessly\", while again criticizing the interface for being \"confusing\" and that the file view was \"not quite intuitive enough\" without file icons. Grabham also reviewed the mobile Android app, writing that \"it's a pretty simple app that enables you to access your files on the move and save some for offline access should you wish\", and praised Google Docs creation and photo uploading for being \"easy\". He also praised that \"everything is easily searchable\".[85]A review by Michael Muchmore of PC Magazine in February 2016 praised the service as \"truly impressive\" in creating and editing files, describing its features as \"leading\" in office-suite collaboration. He added that \"Compatibility is rarely an issue\", with importing and exporting options, and that the free storage of 15 gigabytes was \"generous\". However, he also criticized the user interface for being confusing to navigate, and wrote that \"Offline editing isn't simple\".[86]The Android version of Google Drive has been criticized for requiring users to individually toggle each file for use offline instead of allowing entire folders to be stored offline.[87]Immediately after its announcement in April 2012, Google faced criticism over Google Drive privacy. In particular, privacy advocates have noted that Google has one unified set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements for all its products and services. In a CNET report, Zack Whittaker noted that \"the terms and service have come under heavy fire by the wider community for how it handles users' copyright and intellectual property rights\". In a comparison of Terms of Service agreements between Google Drive and competing cloud storage services Dropbox and OneDrive, he cited a paragraph stating that Google has broad rights to reproduce, use, and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive, via a license from its users. Although the user retains intellectual property rights, the user licenses Google to extract and parse uploaded content to customize advertising and other services that Google provides to the user, and to promote the service. Summarized, he wrote that \"According to its terms, Google does not own user-uploaded files to Google Drive, but the company can do whatever it likes with them\".[88] In a highly critical editorial of the service, Ed Bott of ZDNet wrote that language in the agreements contained \"exact same words\" as Dropbox used in a July 2011 Privacy Policy update that sparked criticism and forced Dropbox to update its policy once again with clarifying language, adding that \"It's a perfect example of Google's inability to pay even the slightest bit of attention to anything that happens outside the Googleplex\".[89] Matt Peckham of Time criticized the lack of unique service agreements for Drive, writing that \"If any Google service warrants privacy firewalling, itâs Google Drive. This isnât YouTube or Calendar or even Gmailââthe potential for someoneâs most sensitive data to be snooped, whether to glean info for marketing or otherwise, is too high. [...] Google ought to create a privacy exception that ânarrows the scopeâ of its service terms for Google Drive, one that minimally states the company will never circulate the information generated from searching within [sic] your G-Drive data in any way.\"[90]In contrast, a report by Nilay Patel of The Verge stated that \"all web services should be subject to harsh scrutiny of their privacy policiesâbut a close and careful reading reveals that Google's terms are pretty much the same as anyone else's, and slightly better in some cases\", pointing to the fact that Google \"couldn't move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails\" without proper rights. In comparing the policies with competing services, Patel wrote that \"it's clear that they need the exact same permissionsâthey just use slightly more artful language to communicate them\".[91]On November 12, 2013, Google announced that Google Drive had 120 million active users, a figure that the company was releasing for the first time.[92]On June 25, 2014 at the Google I/O developer conference, Sundar Pichai announced that Google Drive now had 190 million monthly active users, and that it was being used by 58% of the Fortune 500 companies as well as by 72 of the top universities.[93]On October 1, 2014, at its Atmosphere Live event, it was announced that Google Drive had 240 million monthly active users.

        "name": "Earth",
        "text": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.265 days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.265 times.[n 6]Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Over 7.7 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has around 200 sovereign states.The modern English word Earth developed from a wide variety of Middle English forms,[n 7] which derived from an Old English noun most often spelled eorÃ°e.[23] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their proto-Germanic root has been reconstructed as *erÃ¾Å. In its earliest appearances, eorÃ°e was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek Î³á¿ (gÄ): the ground,[n 8] its soil,[n 9] dry land,[n 10] the human world,[n 11] the surface of the world (including the sea),[n 12] and the globe itself.[n 13] As with Terra and Gaia, Earth was a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: the Angles were listed by Tacitus as among the devotees of Nerthus,[32] and later Norse mythology included JÃ¶rÃ°, a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.[33]Originally, earth was written in lowercase, and from early Middle English, its definite sense as \"the globe\" was expressed as the earth. By Early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth became (and often remained) the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets.[23] House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes \"Earth\" when appearing as a name (e.g. \"Earth's atmosphere\") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (e.g. \"the atmosphere of the earth\"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as \"what on earth are you doing?\"[34]The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5672Â±0.0006 billion years ago (Bya).[35] By 4.54Â±0.04 Bya[36] the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth taking 10â20 million years (Mys) to form.[37]A subject of research is the formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya.[38] A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, hit Earth.[39] In this view, the mass of Theia was approximately 10 percent of Earth,[40] it hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.[41] Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Bya, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.[42] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.[43] In this model, atmospheric \"greenhouse gases\" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.[44] By 3.5 Bya, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[45]A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled to form a solid. The two models[46] that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms[47] or, more likely, a rapid growth[48] early in Earth history[49] followed by a long-term steady continental area.[50][51][52] Continents formed by plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, the supercontinents have assembled and broken apart. Roughly 750 million years ago (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia 600â540 Mya, then finally Pangaea, which also broke apart 180 Mya.[53]The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 Mya,[54] and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Mya.[55] High-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 40,000â100,000 years. The last continental glaciation ended 10,000 years ago.[56]Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose.[57] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O\n2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O\n3) in the upper atmosphere.[58] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[59] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[60] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[61] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[62] and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[63][64] The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.[65][66]During the Neoproterozoic, 750 to 580 Mya, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed \"Snowball Earth\", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[67] Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Mya, there have been five mass extinctions.[68] The most recent such event was 66 Mya, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as mammals, which at the time resembled shrews. Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66 Mys, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as Orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright.[69] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.[70]Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%.[71] The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO\n2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100â900 million years.[72][73] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.[74] About a billion years from now, all surface water will have disappeared[75] and the mean global temperature will reach 70 Â°C (158 Â°F).[74] The Earth is expected to be habitable until the end of photosynthesis about 500 million years from now,[72] but if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere, life may continue until a runaway greenhouse effect occurs 2.3 billion years from now.[73] Anthropogenic emissions are \"probably insufficient\" to cause a runaway greenhouse at current solar luminosity.[76] Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[77]The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius.[71][78] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).[71] A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[78]The shape of Earth is nearly spherical. There is a small flattening at the poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth's rotation.[82] To second order, the Earth is approximately an oblate spheroid, whose equatorial diameter is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter,[83] although the variation is less than 1% of the average radius of the Earth.The point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador (6,384.4 km or 3,967.1 mi).[84][85][86][87] The average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi). Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: the maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10,911 metres or 35,797 feet below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest (8,848 metres or 29,029 feet above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.[n 14]In geodesy, the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level.Earth's mass is approximately 5.97Ã1024 kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulphur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulphur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[91]The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulphur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash and soda.[92][91][93]Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the MohoroviÄiÄ discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30â50 km (19â31 mi) for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km (250 and 410 mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core.[94] The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1â0.5Â° per year.[95] The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.Earth's internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%).[98] The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232.[99] At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 Â°C (10,830 Â°F),[100] and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi).[101] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.[98][102]The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW mâ2, for a global heat loss of 4.42Ã1013 W.[104] A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts.[105] More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.[106]Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: At convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur.[108] The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.[109]As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200 Ma old.[110][111] By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030 Ma.[112]The seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American. Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55 Mya. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/a (3.0 in/year)[113] and the Pacific Plate moving 52â69 mm/a (2.0â2.7 in/year). At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 21 mm/a (0.83 in/year).[114]The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi).[12] Of this, 70.8%,[12] or 361.13 million km2 (139.43 million sq mi), is below sea level and covered by ocean water.[115] Below the ocean's surface are much of the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes,[83] oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system. The remaining 29.2%, or 148.94 million km2 (57.51 million sq mi), not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. Tectonics and erosion, volcanic eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the growth of coral reefs, and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape the Earth's surface over geological time.[116][117]The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.[118] Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust.[119] The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine.[120] Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.[121]The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of â418 m (â1,371 ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).[122]The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. The total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland.[123][124] Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for agriculture, or an estimated 16.7 million km2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km2 (12.9 million sq mi) of pastureland.[125]The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the \"Blue Planet\" from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m (6,600 ft). The deepest underwater location is Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of 10,911.4 m (35,799 ft).[n 18][126]The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35Ã1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi).[127] If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi).[128][129]About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.[130]The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).[131] Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.[132] The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.[133] Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.[134] Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation.[135]The atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi),[136] with a scale height of about 8.5 km (5.3 mi).[3] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules.[136] Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4%[136] but averages about 1%.[3] The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.[137]Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogenâoxygen atmosphere of today.[58] This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O\n2 into O\n3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land.[138] Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.[139] This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be â18 Â°C (0 Â°F), in contrast to the current +15 Â°C (59 Â°F),[140] and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.[141] In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.[142][143]Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.[144]The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30Â° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30Â° and 60Â°.[145] Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.[146]Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.[144] Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.[147]The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 Â°C (0.7 Â°F) per degree of latitude from the equator.[148] Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.[149]This latitudinal rule has several anomalies:The commonly used KÃ¶ppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.[145] The KÃ¶ppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was 56.7 Â°C (134.1 Â°F) in Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley, in 1913.[152] The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was â89.2 Â°C (â128.6 Â°F) at Vostok Station in 1983,[153] but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as â94.7 Â°C (â138.5 Â°F) in East Antarctica.[154] These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth.Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[139] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind.[155] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.[156]Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.[157] The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.[158] Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.[159] In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.[160]The gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the Earth. Near the Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2). Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies.[161]The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05Ã10â5 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79Ã1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century.[162] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.[163][164]The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.[165] Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.[166] Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates;[167][168] the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,[169] and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.[165][170]During magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.[171]Earth's rotation period relative to the Sunâits mean solar dayâis 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds).[172] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer.[173][174]Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s.[2][n 19] Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox, misnamed its sidereal day, is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s).[2] Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.[175] The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623â2005[176] and 1962â2005.[177]Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15Â°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.[178][179]Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1Â°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hoursâa solar dayâfor Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.[3]The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined with the EarthâMoon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the EarthâSun plane (the ecliptic), and the EarthâMoon plane is tilted up to Â±5.1 degrees against the EarthâSun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.[3][180]The Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of the Earth is about 1.5 million km (930,000 mi) in radius.[181][n 20] This is the maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center. It is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.[182]The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281Â°[2] with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.Above the Arctic Circle, an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a polar night. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solsticesâthe points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sunâand the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.[183]The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years.[184] The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800 year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.[185]In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing EarthâSun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%[n 21] in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.[186]A study from 2016 suggested that Planet Nine tilted all the planets of the Solar System, including Earth, by about six degrees.[187]A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid waterâan environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism.[188] The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.[189]A planet's life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total is sometimes said to form a \"biosphere\".[190] Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun evolving about 3.5 Gya.[58] The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals.[191] On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and humidity. Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or Antarctic Circles, at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes.[192]In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth.[193]Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans.[195] Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, only renew over geological timescales.[196]Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas.[197] These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production.[198] Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics.[199] These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements.Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.[200] In 1980, 50.53 million km2 (19.51 million sq mi) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 67.88 million km2 (26.21 million sq mi) was grasslands and pasture, and 15.01 million km2 (5.80 million sq mi) was cultivated as croplands.[201] The estimated amount of irrigated land in 1993 was 2,481,250 km2 (958,020 sq mi).[13] Humans also live on the land by using building materials to construct shelters.Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, or typhoons that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.[202] Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, sinkholes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.Many localized areas are subject to human-made pollution of the air and water, acid rain and toxic substances, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.There is a scientific consensus linking human activities to global warming due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a global rise in average sea levels.[203]Cartography, the study and practice of map-making, and geography, the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth. Surveying, the determination of locations and distances, and to a lesser extent navigation, the determination of position and direction, have developed alongside cartography and geography, providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information.Earth's human population reached approximately seven billion on 31 October 2011.[205] Projections indicate that the world's human population will reach 9.2 billion in 2050.[206] Most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations. Human population density varies widely around the world, but a majority live in Asia. By 2020, 60% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas.[207]68% of the land mass of the world is in the northern hemisphere.[208] Partly due to the predominance of land mass, 90% of humans live in the northern hemisphere.[209]It is estimated that one-eighth of Earth's surface is suitable for humans to live on â three-quarters of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, leaving one-quarter as land. Half of that land area is desert (14%),[210] high mountains (27%),[211] or other unsuitable terrains. The northernmost permanent settlement in the world is Alert, on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.[212] (82Â°28â²N) The southernmost is the AmundsenâScott South Pole Station, in Antarctica, almost exactly at the South Pole. (90Â°S)Independent sovereign nations claim the planet's entire land surface, except for some parts of Antarctica, a few land parcels along the Danube river's western bank, and the unclaimed area of Bir Tawil between Egypt and Sudan. As of 2015, there are 193 sovereign states that are member states of the United Nations, plus two observer states and 72 dependent territories and states with limited recognition.[13] Earth has never had a sovereign government with authority over the entire globe, although some nation-states have striven for world domination and failed.[213]The United Nations is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations, thereby avoiding armed conflict.[214] The U.N. serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law. When the consensus of the membership permits, it provides a mechanism for armed intervention.[215]The first human to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961.[216] In total, about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of 30 July 2010, and, of these, twelve have walked on the Moon.[217][218][219] Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually replaced every six months.[220] The farthest that humans have traveled from Earth is 400,171 km (248,655 mi), achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.[221]The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's.The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/a (1.5 in/year). Over millions of years, these tiny modificationsâand the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 Âµs/yrâadd up to significant changes.[222] During the Devonian period, for example, (approximately 410 Mya) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.[223]The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.[224] Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.[225]Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.[179] This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.[41]Earth has at least five co-orbital asteroids, including 3753 Cruithne and 2002 AA29.[226][227] A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.[228][229]The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the EarthâMoon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.[230]As of April 2018, there are 1,886 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth.[5] There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris.[n 3] Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.The standard astronomical symbol of Earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle, ,[231] representing the four corners of the world.Human cultures have developed many views of the planet.[232] Earth is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity,[233] and by the mid-20th century, the Gaia Principle compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability.[234][235][236] Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.[233]Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in the Greek colonies of southern Italy during the late 6th century BC by the idea of spherical Earth,[237][238][239] which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides.[238][239] By the end of the 5th century BC, the sphericity of Earth was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.[240] Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first conclusively demonstrated that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System.[241] Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.[242]Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.[243][244] The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the Apollo program.[245][246][247]"

The service featured business and enterprise headlines for many corporations including their financial decisions and major news events. Stock information was available, as were Adobe Flash-based stock price charts which contained marks for major news events and corporate actions. The site also aggregated Google News and Google Blog Search articles about each corporation, though links were not screened and often deemed untrustworthy.[1]Google launched a revamped version of their finance site on December 12, 2006, featuring a new homepage design which lets users see currency information, sector performance for the United States market and a listing of top market movers along with the relevant and important news of the day. A top movers section was also added, based on popularity determined by Google Trends. The upgrade also featured charts containing up to 40 years of data for U.S. stocks, and richer portfolio options. Another update brought real-time ticker updates for stocks to the site, as both NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange partnered with Google in June 2008.[2][3] Google added advertising to its finance page on November 18, 2008. However, since 2008, it has not undergone any major upgrades and the Google Finance Blog was closed in August 2012.On September 22, 2017, Google confirmed that the website was under renovation and that portfolio features would not be available after mid-November 2017.[4][5]In early 2018, a notice on the website announced that the website had been renovated. The notice said that the portfolio feature was to be removed, and advised that stocks from the old portfolio feature would be migrated to the new website, and also giving the option for users to download the portfolio as a CSV file.[6]Many users were quite surprised. In a series of unlikely business decisions, Google offered a superior product for free, never monetized it, and subsequently killed the product after building a large and dedicated user base. Little is known of the business context of these decisions from Google, but its obvious that there is a high likelihood of 3rd party players beyond the market supply/demand forces[citation needed]."

It was first released on iOS in May 2016, followed by a release on Android in December 2016, debuting as a major update to the already-established Google Keyboard app on Android.Gboard features Google Search, including web results and predictive answers, easy searching and sharing of GIF and emoji content, a predictive typing engine suggesting the next word depending on context, and multilingual language support. Updates to the keyboard have enabled additional functionality, including GIF suggestions, options for a dark color theme or adding a personal image as the keyboard background, support for voice dictation, next-phrase prediction, and hand-drawn emoji recognition. At the time of its launch on iOS, the keyboard only offered support for the English language, with more languages being gradually added in the following months, whereas on Android, the keyboard supported more than 100 languages at the time of release.In August 2018, Gboard passed 1 billion installs on the Google Play Store, making it one of the most popular Android apps.[7][8][9][10][11] This is measured by the Google Play Store and includes downloads by users as well as pre-installed instances of the app.[12]Gboard is a virtual keyboard app. It features Google Search, including web results and predictive answers, easy searching and sharing of GIF and emoji content, and a predictive typing engine suggesting the next word depending on context.[13] At its May 2016 launch on iOS, Gboard only supported the English language,[13] while it supported \"more than 100 languages\" at the time of its launch on the Android platform. Google states that Gboard will add more languages \"over the coming months\".[8] As of October 2019, 916 languages are supported.[14]Gboard features Floating Keyboard[15] and Google Translate in Gboard itself.[16] Gboard supports one-handed mode on Android after its May 2016 update.[17] This functionality was added to the app when it was branded as Google Keyboard.[18]An update for the iOS app released in August 2016 added French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish languages, as well as offering \"smart GIF suggestions\", where the keyboard will suggest GIFs relevant to text written. The keyboard also offers new options for a dark theme or adding a personal image from the camera roll as the keyboard's background.[19] Another new update in March 2018 added Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Polish, Romanian, Balochi, Swedish, Catalan, Hungarian, Malay, Russian, Latin American Spanish, and Turkish languages, along with support for voice dictation, enabling users to \"long press the mic button on the space bar and talk\".[20][21] In April 2017, Google significantly increased the amount of Indian languages supported on Gboard, adding 11 new languages, bringing the total number of supported Indian languages to 22.[22][23]In June 2017, the Android app was updated to support recognition of hand-drawn emoji and the ability to predict whole phrases rather than single words.

The Wall Street Journal also praised the predictive typing engine, stating that it \"blows past most competitors\" and \"it gets smarter with use\". They also discovered that Gboard \"cleverly suggests emojis as you type words\".

        "name": "Gmail",
        "text": "Gmail is a free email service developed by Google. Users can access Gmail on the web and using third-party programs that synchronize email content through POP or IMAP protocols. Gmail started as a limited beta release on April 1, 2004 and ended its testing phase on July 7, 2009.At launch, Gmail had an initial storage capacity offer of one gigabyte per user, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time. Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of storage. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message. Gmail has a search-oriented interface and a \"conversation view\" similar to an Internet forum. The service is notable among website developers for its early adoption of Ajax.Google's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to filter spam and malware, and to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails. This advertising practice has been significantly criticized by privacy advocates due to concerns over unlimited data retention, ease of monitoring by third parties, users of other email providers not having agreed to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, and the potential for Google to change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data usage. The company has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues. Google has stated that email users must \"necessarily expect\" their emails to be subject to automated processing and claims that the service refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those mentioning race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements. In June 2017, Google announced the upcoming end to the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising purposes, relying instead on data gathered from the use of its other services.[3]By February 2016, Gmail had one billion active users worldwide.[4]There are also storage limits to individual Gmail messages. Initially, one message, including all attachments, could not be larger than 25 megabytes.[11] This was changed in March 2017 to allow receiving an email of up to 50 megabytes, while the limit for sending an email staying at 25 megabytes.[12][13] In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message.[14]The Gmail user interface initially differed from other web-mail systems with its focus on search and conversation threading of emails, grouping several messages between two or more people onto a single page, an approach that was later copied by its competitors. Gmail's user interface designer, Kevin Fox, intended users to feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page, rather than having to navigate to other places.[15]Gmail's interface also makes use of 'labels' (tags) â that replace the conventional folders and provide a more flexible method of organizing email; filters for automatically organizing, deleting or forwarding incoming emails to other addresses; and importance markers for automatically marking messages as 'important'.In November 2011, Google began rolling out a redesign of its interface that \"simplified\" the look of Gmail into a more minimalist design to provide a more consistent look throughout its products and services as part of an overall Google design change. Major redesigned elements included a streamlined conversation view, configurable density of information, new higher-quality themes, a resizable navigation bar with always-visible labels and contacts, and better search.[16][17] Users were able to preview the new interface design for months prior to the official release, as well as revert to the old interface, until March 2012, when Google discontinued the ability to revert and completed the transition to the new design for all users.[18]In May 2013, Google updated the Gmail inbox with tabs which allow the application to categorize the user's emails. The five tabs are: Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums. In addition to customization options, the entire update can be disabled, allowing users to return to the traditional inbox structure.[19][20]In April 2018, Google introduced a new web UI for Gmail. The new redesign follows Google's Material Design, and changes in user interface include the use of Google's Product Sans font. Other updates include a Confidential mode, which allows the sender to set an expiration date for a sensitive message or to revoke it entirely, integrated rights management and two-factor authentication.[21]In October 2019, Gmail was scheduled to get a dark mode for iOS and Android apps though the spokesperson said it was a limited roll out for Android 10 and iOS 11 users[22]Gmail's spam filtering features a community-driven system: when any user marks an email as spam, this provides information to help the system identify similar future messages for all Gmail users.[23]In the April 2018 update, the spam filtering banners got a redesign, with bigger and bolder lettering.The Gmail Labs feature, introduced on June 5, 2008, allows users to test new or experimental features of Gmail. Users can enable or disable Labs features selectively and provide feedback about each of them. This allows Gmail engineers to obtain user input about new features to improve them and also to assess their popularity.[24]Popular features, like the \"Undo Send\" option, often \"graduate\" from Gmail Labs to become a formal setting in Gmail.[25]All Labs features are experimental and are subject to termination at any time.[26]Gmail incorporates a search bar for searching emails. The search bar can also search contacts, files stored in Google Drive, events from Google Calendar, and Google Sites.[27][28][29]In May 2012, Gmail improved the search functionality to include auto-complete predictions from the user's emails.[30]Gmail's search functionality does not support searching for word fragments (also known as 'substring search' or partial word search). Workarounds exist.[30]As of March 2015, the Gmail interface supports 72 languages, including: Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (UK), English (US), Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian (BokmÃ¥l), Odia, Polish, Punjabi, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, Welsh and Zulu.[31]In October 2012, Google added over 100 virtual keyboards, transliterations, and input method editors to Gmail, enabling users different types of input styles for different languages in an effort to help users write in languages that aren't \"limited by the language of your keyboard.â[32][33]In October 2013, Google added handwriting input support to Gmail.[34]In August 2014, Gmail became the first major email provider to let users send and receive email from addresses with accent marks and letters from outside the Latin alphabet.[35][36]Gmail's \"basic HTML\" version will work on almost all browsers. The modern AJAX version is officially supported in the current and previous major releases of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari web browsers on a rolling basis.[37][38]In August 2011, Google introduced Gmail Offline, an HTML5-powered app for providing access to the service while offline. Gmail Offline runs on the Google Chrome browser and can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.[39][40][41]In addition to the native apps on iOS and Android, users can access Gmail through the web browser on a mobile device.[42]Gmail has native applications for iOS devices[43] (including iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) and for Android devices.[44]In November 2014, Google introduced functionality in the Gmail Android app that enabled sending and receiving email from non-Gmail addresses (such as Yahoo! Mail and Outlook.com) through POP or IMAP.[45]In November 2016, Google redesigned the Gmail app for the iOS platform, bringing the first complete visual overhaul in \"nearly four years\". The update added much more use of colors, sleeker transitions, and the addition of several \"highly-requested\" features, including Undo Send, faster search with instant results and spelling suggestions, and Swipe to Archive/Delete.[46][47]In May 2017, Google updated Gmail on Android to feature protection from phishing attacks.[48][49][50] Media outlets noticed that the new protection was announced amid a widespread phishing attack on a combination of Gmail and Google's Docs document service that occurred on the same day.[49][50]Later in May, Google announced the addition of \"Smart Reply\" to Gmail on Android and iOS. \"Smart Reply\", a feature originally launched for Google's Inbox by Gmail service, scans a message for information and uses machine intelligence to offer three responses the user can optionally edit and send. The feature is limited to the English language at launch, with upcoming support for Spanish, followed by other languages later.[51][52]Inbox by Gmail, another app from the Gmail team, is also available for iOS[53] and Android[54] devices.Third-party programs can be used to access Gmail, using the POP or IMAP protocols.[55] In 2019, Google rolled out dark mode for its mobile apps in Android and iOS.[56]In October 2014, Google introduced Inbox by Gmail on an invitation-only basis. Developed by the Gmail team, but serving as a \"completely different type of inbox\", the service is made to help users deal with the challenges of an active email. Citing issues such as distractions, difficulty in finding important information buried in messages, and receiving more emails than ever, Inbox by Gmail has several important differences from Gmail, including bundles that automatically sort emails of the same topic together, highlights that surface key information from messages, and reminders, assists, and snooze, that help the user in handling incoming emails at appropriate times.[57][58][59]Inbox by Gmail became publicly available in May 2015.[60] In September 2018, Google announced it would end the service at the end March 2019, most of its key features having been incorporated into the standard Gmail service.[61] The service was discontinued on April 2, 2019.[62]In August 2010, Google released a plugin that provides integrated telephone service within Gmail's Google Chat interface. The feature initially lacked an official name, with Google referring to it as both \"Google Voice in Gmail chat\" and \"Call Phones in Gmail\".[63][64][65] The service logged over one million calls in 24 hours.[65][66] In March 2014, Google Voice was discontinued, and replaced with functionality from Google Hangouts, another communication platform from Google.[67][68]On February 9, 2010, Google commenced its new social networking tool, Google Buzz, which integrated with Gmail, allowing users to share links and media, as well as status updates.[69] Google Buzz was discontinued in October 2011, replaced with new functionality in Google+, Google's then-new social networking platform.[70][71]Gmail was integrated with Google+ in December 2011, as part of an effort to have all Google information across one Google account, with a centralized Google+ user profile.[72] Backlash from the move caused Google to step back and remove the requirement of a Google+ user account, keeping only a private Google account without a public-facing profile, starting in July 2015.[73]In May 2013, Google announced the integration between Google Wallet and Gmail, which would allow Gmail users to send money as email attachments. Although the sender must use a Gmail account, the recipient does not need to be using a Gmail address.[74][75] The feature has no transaction fees, but there are limits to amount of money that can be sent.[76] Initially only available on the web, the feature was expanded to the Android app in March 2017, for people living in the United States.[77][78]In September 2016, Google released Google Trips, an app that, based on information from a user's Gmail messages, automatically generates travel cards. A travel card contains itinerary details, such as plane tickets and car rentals, and recommends activities, food and drinks, and attractions based on location, time, and interests. The app also has offline functionality.[79][80] In April 2017, Google Trips received an update adding several significant features. The app now also scans Gmail for bus and train tickets, and allows users to manually input trip reservations. Users can send trip details to other users' email, and if the recipient also has Google Trips, the information will be automatically available in their apps as well.[81][82]Google has supported secure HTTPS since the day it launched. In the beginning, it was only default on the login page, a reason that Google engineer Ariel Rideout stated was because HTTPS made \"your mail slower\". However, users could manually switch to secure HTTPS mode inside the inbox after logging in. In July 2008, Google simplified the ability to manually enable secure mode, with a toggle in the settings menu.[83]In 2007, Google fixed a cross-site scripting security issue that could let attackers collect information from Gmail contact lists.[84]In January 2010, Google began rolling out HTTPS as the default for all users.[85]In June 2012, a new security feature was introduced to protect users from state-sponsored attacks. A banner will appear at the top of the page that warns users of an unauthorized account compromise.[86][87]In March 2014, Google announced that an encrypted HTTPS connection will be used for the sending and receiving of all Gmail emails, and \"every single email message you send or receive â100% of them âis encrypted while moving internally\" through the company's systems.[88]Whenever possible, Gmail uses transport layer security (TLS) to automatically encrypt emails sent and received. On the web and on Android devices, users can check if a message is encrypted by checking if the message has a closed or open red padlock.[89]Gmail automatically scans all incoming and outgoing e-mails for viruses in email attachments. For security reasons, some file types, including executables, are not allowed to be sent in emails.[90]At the end of May 2017, Google announced that it had applied machine learning technology to identify emails with phishing and spam, having a 99.9% detection accuracy. The company also announced that Gmail would selectively delay some messages, approximately 0.05% of all, to perform more detailed analysis and aggregate details to improve its algorithms.[91][92]In Google's Transparency Report under the Safer email section, it provides information on the percentage of emails encrypted in transit between Gmail and third-party email providers.[93]Gmail supports two-step verification, an optional additional measure for users to protect their accounts when logging in.[94]Once enabled, users are required to verify their identity using a second method after entering their username and password when logging in on a new device. Common methods include entering a code sent to a user's mobile phone through a text message, entering a code using the Google Authenticator smartphone app, or by inserting a physical security key into the computer's USB port.[95]Using a security key for two-step verification was made available as an option in October 2014.[96][97]If an algorithm detects what Google calls \"abnormal usage that may indicate that your account has been compromised\", the account can be automatically locked down for between one minute and 24 hours, depending on the type of activity detected. Listed reasons for a lock-down include:[98]Google combats child pornography through Gmail's servers in conjunction with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) to find children suffering abuse around the world. In collaboration with the NCMEC, Google creates a database of child pornography pictures. Each one of the images is given a unique numerical number known as a hash. Google then scans Gmail looking for the unique hashes. When suspicious images are located Google reports the incident to the appropriate national authorities.[99]The idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public. The project was known by the code name Caribou. During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google's own engineers. This changed once the project became better and better, and by early 2004, almost everybody was using it to access the company's internal email system.[100]Gmail was announced to the public by Google on April 1, 2004 as a limited beta release.[101]In November 2006, Google began offering a Java-based application of Gmail for mobile phones.[102]In October 2007, Google began a process of rewriting parts of the code that Gmail used, which would make the service faster and add new features, such as custom keyboard shortcuts and the ability to bookmark specific messages and email searches.[103] Gmail also added IMAP support in October 2007.[104]An update around January 2008 changed elements of Gmail's use of JavaScript, and resulted in the failure of a third-party script some users had been using. Google acknowledge the issue and helped users with workarounds.[105]Gmail exited the beta status on July 7, 2009.[106]Prior to December 2013, users had to approve to see images in emails, which acted as a security measure. This changed in December 2013, when Google, citing improved image handling, enabled images to be visible without user approval. Images will be routed through Google's secure proxy servers rather than the original external host servers.[107] MarketingLand noted that the change to image handling means email marketers will no longer be able to track the recipient's IP address or information about what kind of device the recipient is using.[108] However, Wired stated that the new change means senders can track the time when an email is first opened, as the initial loading of the images requires the system to make a \"callback\" to the original server.[109]In June 2012, Google announced that Gmail had 425 million active users globally.[110] In May 2015, Google announced that Gmail had 900 million active users, 75% of whom were using the service on mobile devices.[111] In February 2016, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1 billion active users.[4][112] In July 2017, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1.2 billion active users.[113][114]In the business sector, Quartz reported in August 2014 that, among 150 companies checked in three major categories in the United States (Fortune 50 largest companies, mid-size tech and media companies, and startup companies from the last Y Combinator incubator class), only one Fortune 50 company used Gmail â Google itself â while 60% of mid-sized companies and 92% of startup companies were using Gmail.[115]In May 2014, Gmail became the first app on the Google Play Store to hit one billion installations on Android devices.[116]As part of G Suite, Google's business-focused offering, Gmail comes with additional features, including:[117]Gmail is noted by web developers for its early adoption of Ajax.[122]Gmail was ranked second in PC World's \"100 Best Products of 2005\", behind Mozilla Firefox. Gmail also won 'Honorable Mention' in the Bottom Line Design Awards 2005.[123][124] In September 2006, Forbes declared Gmail to be the best webmail application for small businesses.[125] In November 2006, Gmail received PC World's 4 star rating.[126]Google has one privacy policy that covers all of its services.[127]Google claims that Gmail refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those that mention race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements.[128]Google's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails, and to filter spam and malware.[129][130][131]Privacy advocates raised concerns about this practice; concerns included that allowing email content to be read by a machine (as opposed to a person) can allow Google to keep unlimited amounts of information forever; the automated background scanning of data raises the risk that the expectation of privacy in email usage will be reduced or eroded; information collected from emails could be retained by Google for years after its current relevancy to build complete profiles on users; emails sent by users from other email providers get scanned despite never having agreed to Google's privacy policy or terms of service; Google can change its privacy policy unilaterally, and for minor changes to the policy it can do so without informing users; in court cases, governments and organizations can potentially find it easier to legally monitor email communications; at any time, Google can change its current company policies to allow combining information from emails with data gathered from use of its other services; and any internal security problem on Google's systems can potentially expose many â or all â of its users.[129][131][130][132][133]In 2004, thirty-one privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed. The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units. The organizations also voiced their concerns about Google's plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement, noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third-party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider.[131]On June 23, 2017, Google announced that, later in 2017, it will phase out the scanning of email content to generate contextual advertising, relying on personal data collected through other Google services instead. The company stated that this change was meant to clarify its practices and quell concerns among enterprise G Suite customers who felt an ambiguous distinction between the free consumer and paid professional variants, the latter being advertising-free.[3][134]In March 2011, a former Gmail user in Texas sued Google, claiming that its Gmail service violates users' privacy by scanning e-mail messages to serve relevant ads.[135]In July 2012, some California residents filed two class action lawsuits against Google and Yahoo!, claiming that they illegally intercept emails sent by individual non-Gmail or non-Yahoo! email users to Gmail and Yahoo! recipients without the senders' knowledge, consent or permission.[136] A motion filed by Google's attorneys in the case concedes that Gmail users have \"no expectation of privacy\".[137]A court filing uncovered by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog in August 2013 revealed that Google stated in a court filing that no \"reasonable expectation\" exists among Gmail users in regard to the assured confidentiality of their emails.[138] In response to a lawsuit filed in May 2013, Google explained:\"... all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing ...  Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient's assistant opens the letter, people who use web-based email today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipient's ECS [electronic communications service] provider in the course of delivery.[138]A Google spokesperson stated to the media on August 15, 2013 that the corporation takes the privacy and security concerns of Gmail users \"very seriously.\"[138]Google updated its terms of service for Gmail in April 2014 to create full transparency for its users in regard to the scanning of email content. The relevant revision states: \"Our automated systems analyse your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customised search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\" A Google spokesperson explained that the corporation wishes for its policies \"to be simple and easy for users to understand.\"In response to the update, Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, stated: \"The really dangerous things that Google is doing are things like the information held in Analytics, cookies in advertising and the profiling that it is able to do on individual accounts\".[130]In 2013, Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads. Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy \"Google's kryptonite.\" In response, Google stated; \"We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive and relevant ... No humans read your e-mail or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information. An automated algorithm â similar to that used for features like Priority Inbox or spam filtering â determines which ads are shown.â The New York Times cites \"Google supporters\", who say that \"Microsoft's ads are distasteful, the last resort of a company that has been unsuccessful at competing against Google on the more noble battleground of products\".[139]In January 2010, Google detected a \"highly sophisticated\" cyber-attack on its infrastructure that originated from China. The targets of the attack were Chinese human rights activists, but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European, American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been \"routinely accessed by third parties\". Additionally, Google stated that their investigation revealed that \"at least\" 20 other large companies from a \"wide range of businesses\" - including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors â had been similarly targeted. Google was in the process of notifying those companies and it was also working with relevant US authorities. In light of the attacks, Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure, and advised individual users to install anti-virus and anti-spyware on their computers, update their operating systems and web browsers, and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails.[140][141]The February 2010 launch of Google Buzz, a former social network that was linked to Gmail, immediately drew criticism for publicly sharing details of users' contacts unless the default settings were changed.[142][143] A new Gmail feature was launched in January 2014, whereby users can email people with Google+ accounts even though they do not know the email address of the recipient. Marc Rotenberg, President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, called the feature \"troubling\", and compared it to the Google Buzz initial launch privacy flaw.[144]In June 2016, Julia Angwin of ProPublica wrote about Google's updated privacy policy, which deleted a clause that had stated Google would not combine DoubleClick web browsing cookie information with personally identifiable information from its other services. This change has allowed Google to merge users' personally identifiable information from different Google services to create one unified ad profile for each user. After publication of the article, Google reached out to ProPublica to say that the merge would not include Gmail keywords in ad targeting.[145]Gmail suffered at least seven outages in 2009 alone, causing doubts about the reliability of its service.[146][147] It suffered a new outage on February 28, 2011, in which a bug caused Gmail accounts to be empty. Google stated in a blog post that \"email was never lost\" and restoration was in progress.[148] Another outage occurred on April 17, 2012,[149] September 24, 2013,[150] January 24, 2014,[151] and January 29, 2019.[152]Google has stated that \"Gmail remains more than 99.9% available to all users, and we're committed to keeping events like today's notable for their rarity.\"[153]In May 2009, Farhad Manjoo wrote on The New York Times blog about Gmail's \"on behalf of\" tag. Manjoo explained: \"The problems is, when you try to send outbound mail from your Gmail universal inbox, Gmail adds a tag telling your recipients that you're actually using Gmail and not your office e-mail. If your recipient is using Microsoft Outlook, he'll see a message like, 'From youroffice@domain.com on behalf of yourgmail@gmail.com.'\" Manjoo further wrote that \"Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e-mail from being considered spam by your recipient; the theory is that if the e-mail is honest about its origins, it shouldn't arouse suspicion by spam checking software\".[154] The following July, Google announced a new option that would remove the \"On behalf of\" tag, by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using Gmail's servers.[155]"

        "name": "Google Alerts",
        "text": "Google Alerts is a content change detection and notification service, offered by the search engine company Google. The service sends emails to the user when it finds new resultsâsuch as web pages, newspaper articles, blogs, or scientific researchâthat match the user's search term(s).[1][2] In 2003, Google launched Google alerts which were the result of Naga Kataru's efforts. His name is on the three patents for Google Alerts.[3]Google reported the system was not functioning properly as of 2013: \"weâre having some issues with Alerts not being as comprehensive as weâd like\".[4] However, the service is still operational and completely accessible around the world.[5] Google Alerts continued to face critical performance issues and temporary regional unavailability but the Google technical support has been successfully addressing the reported issues by users on its official forum.[6]Indexing is a term known in the SEO community when Google sends out its bots to crawl a site and the page is added into their database and will come up when a user types in a certain set of keywords. DigitalGov puts it this way, \"If the website is optimized correctly, Google and other search engines will spider and index the pages and their respective keywords, allowing the government website to show up high on search engines when a user is searching for related information.\""

        "name": "Google Cast",
        "text": "Google Cast, branded for consumer devices as Chromecast built-in,[1] is a proprietary protocol developed by Google that enables mobile devices and personal computers to initiate and control playback of Internet-streamed audio/video content on a compatible device, such as a digital media player connected to a high-definition television or home audio system. The protocol was first launched on July 24, 2013, to support Google's first-generation Chromecast player. The Google Cast SDK was released on February 3, 2014, allowing third parties to modify their software to support the protocol. According to Google, over 20,000 Google Cast-ready apps were available as of May 2015. Google Cast would later be built into the Nexus Player and other Android TV devices (such as televisions), as well as soundbars, speakers, and subsequent Chromecast players. As of October 2017, over 55 million Chromecasts and Chromecast built-in devices have been sold.[2]Google Cast receivers can stream content via two methods: the first employs mobile and web apps that support the Google Cast technology; the second allows mirroring of content from the web browser Google Chrome running on a personal computer, as well as content displayed on some Android devices.[3] In both cases, playback is initiated through the \"cast\" button on the sender device.[4]Sender devices previously needed to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as a Google Cast receiver device to cast content,[12][13] until the addition of a \"guest mode\" feature on December 10, 2014;[14] When enabled, the feature allows sender devices to discover a nearby player by detecting ultrasonic audio emitted by the television or speaker system to which the player is connected;[15][16] alternatively, the sender device can be paired with the receiver device using a four-digit PIN code.[16][17] Guest mode is only available for Chromecasts; the Nexus Player and Android TV devices do not support the feature.[18]At the time of Chromecast's launch, four Google Cast-compatible apps were available: YouTube and Netflix were supported as Android, iOS, and Chrome web apps; Google Play Music and Google Play Movies & TV were also supported, but originally only as Android apps.[20][21] Additional apps supporting casting would require access to the Google Cast software development kit (SDK). The SDK was first released as a preview version on July 24, 2013. Google advised interested developers to use the SDK to create and test apps, but not distribute them.[22] While that admonition remained in force, Google Cast-enabled applications for Hulu Plus and Pandora Radio were released in October 2013, and HBO GO in November.[23][24] Google invited developers to a two-day hackathon on December 7 at Googleplex, its Mountain View headquarters, offering the opportunity to test drive the SDK's \"upcoming release\".[25] The session attracted 40 developers from 30 companies and was followed by 10 additional apps, including Plex, Avia, and Realplayer Cloud.[26]Google opened the SDK to all developers on February 3, 2014.[27] In its introductory documentation and video presentation, Google said the SDK worked with both Chromecast devices and other unnamed \"cast receiver devices\". Chromecast product manager Rish Chandra said that Google used the intervening time to improve the SDK's reliability and accommodate those developers who sought a quick and easy way to cast a photo to a television without a lot of coding. Google also made the SDK a part of the Google Play Services framework, thereby giving users access to new apps without having to update Android itself.[28][29] Over time, many more applications have been updated to support Google Cast. At Google I/O 2014, the company announced that 6,000 registered developers were working on 10,000 Google Castâready apps;[30] by the following year's conference, the number of compatible apps had doubled.[31] Google's official list of compatible apps and platforms is available on the Chromecast website. Google has published case studies documenting Google Cast integration by Comedy Central, Just Dance Now, Haystack TV and Fitnet.[32]The development framework has two components: a sender app and a receiver app, both of which make use of APIs provided by the SDK.Chromecast supports the image formats BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and WEBP, with a display size limitation of 720p (1280 Ã 720 pixels). Supported audio codecs are HE-AAC, LC-AAC, MP3, Vorbis, WAV (LPCM), FLAC (up to 96kHz/24-bit) and Opus; AC-3 (Dolby Digital) and E-AC-3 (EC-3, Dolby Digital Plus) are available for audio pass-through. Supported video codecs for the first and second generation Chromecast are H.264 High Profile Level 4.1 (decoding up to 720p/60 frames per second (fps) or 1080p/30fps) and VP8. Supported video codecs for the third generation Chromecast are H.264 High Profile Level 4.2 (decoding up to 720p/60 (fps) or 1080p/60fps) and VP8.[33] The supported video codecs for the Chromecast Ultra are HEVC / H.265 Main and Main 10 Profiles up to level 5.1 (2160p/60fps) and VP9 Profile 0 and Profile 2 up to level 5.1 (2160p/60fps).[34]At International CES 2015, Google announced an expansion to Google Cast called \"Google Cast for audio\", which allows apps that support the Google Cast SDK to play audio through compatible Wi-Fiâconnected speakers, soundbars, and receivers.[35] Manufacturers supporting Google Cast as a built-in function in their speakers include LG and Sony.[36]In May 2015, Google introduced new sets of APIs to Google Cast. The Cast Remote Display APIs allow developers to create second-screen experiences for apps such as games without needing to mirror displays. The Game Manager APIs offer developers more options for creating multiplayer games.[37] Lastly, additional APIs were provided to control autoplaying and queuing of content.[38]In September 2015, Google announced \"Fast Play\" and accompanying developer tools, which are aimed at reducing the delays between loading content. In a typical scenario, if a user viewed the first three episodes of a television series, the fourth episode might load in the background.[39] The feature's release has since been delayed.[40]"

        "name": "Google Classroom",
        "text": "Google Classroom is a free web service, developed by Google for schools, that aims to simplify creating, distributing, and grading assignments in a paperless way. The primary purpose of Google Classroom is to streamline the process of sharing files between teachers and students.[3]Google Classroom combines Google Drive for assignment creation and distribution, Google Docs, Sheets and Slides for writing, Gmail for communication, and Google Calendar for scheduling. Students can be invited to join a class through a private code, or automatically imported from a school domain. Each class creates a separate folder in the respective user's Drive, where the student can submit work to be graded by a teacher. Mobile apps, available for iOS and Android devices, let users take photos and attach to assignments, share files from other apps, and access information offline. Teachers can monitor the progress for each student, and after being graded, teachers can return work along with comments.Google Classroom was announced on May 6, 2014, with a preview available for some members of Google's G Suite for Education program.[4][5] It was released publicly on August 12, 2014.[6][7] In 2015 Google announced a Classroom API and a share button for websites, allowing school administrators and developers to further engage with Google Classroom.[8] Also in 2015, Google integrated Google Calendar into Classroom for assignment due dates, field trips and class speakers.[9] In 2017, Google opened Classroom to allow any personal Google users to join classes without the requirement of having a G Suite for Education account,[10] and in April of the same year, it became possible for any personal Google user to create and teach a class.[11][12]In 2018, Google announced a classroom refresh, adding a classwork section, improving the grading interface, allowing reuse of classwork from other classes, and adding features for teachers to organize content by topic.[13]In 2019, Google introduced 78 new illustrated themes and the option to drag and drop topics and assignments in the classwork section.[14]Google Classroom ties Google Drive, Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, and Gmail together to help educational institutions go to a paperless system.[15] Google Calendar was later integrated to help with assignment due dates, field trips, and class speakers.[9] Students can be invited to classrooms through the institution's database, through a private code that can then be added in the student's user interface or automatically imported from a school domain.[16] Each class created with Google Classroom creates a separate folder in the respective user's Google Drive, where the student can submit work to be graded by a teacher.[17]Assignments are stored and graded on Google's suite of productivity applications that allow collaboration between the teacher and the student or student to student. Instead of sharing documents that reside on the student's Google Drive with the teacher, files are hosted on the student's Drive and then submitted for grading. Teachers may choose a file that can then be treated as a template so that every student can edit their own copy and then turn back in for a grade instead of allowing all students to view, copy, or edit the same document.[18] Students can also choose to attach additional documents from their Drive to the assignment.Google Classroom supports many different grading schemes. Teachers have the option to attach files to the assignment which students can view, edit, or get an individual copy. Students can create files and then attach them to the assignment if a copy of a file wasn't created by the teacher. Teachers have the option to monitor the progress of each student on the assignment where they can make comments and edit. Turned in assignments can be graded by the teacher and returned with comments to allow the student to revise the assignment and turn back in. Once graded, assignments can only be edited by the teacher unless the teacher turns the assignment back in.Announcements can be posted by teachers to the class stream which can be commented on by students allowing for two-way communication between the teacher and students.[17] Students can also post to the class stream but won't be as high of a priority as an announcement by a teacher and can be moderated. Multiple types of media from Google products such as YouTube videos and Google Drive files can be attached to announcements and posts to share content. Gmail also provides email options for teachers to send emails to one or more students in the Google Classroom interface. Classroom can be accessed on the web or via the Android and iOS Classroom mobile apps.Classroom allows instructors to archive courses at the end of a term or year. When a course is archived, it is removed from the homepage and placed in the Archived Classes area to help teachers keep their current classes organized. When a course is archived, teachers and students can view it, but won't be able to make any changes to it until it is restored.[19]Google Classroom mobile apps, introduced in January 2015, are available for iOS and Android devices. The apps let users take photos and attach them to their assignments, share files from other apps, and support offline access.[20][21]In contrast to Google's consumer services, Google Classroom, as part of G Suite for Education, does not show any advertisements in its interface for students, faculty, and teachers, and user data is not scanned or used for advertising purposes.[22]eLearningIndustry tested and made a review of Google Classroom, in which they highlighted many positive and negative aspects. Among Classroom's strengths, the review highlighted ease of use, universal device accessibility, use of Google Drive as an effective way for teachers to quickly share assignments with students, the paperless process meaning the end of printing, handing out, and potentially losing work, and the fast feedback system between students and teachers. Among Classroom's disadvantages, the review highlighted the service's heavy integration of Google apps and services with limited or no support for external files or services, lack of automated quizzes and tests, and a lack of live chats that can aid in feedback efforts.[23]As a company Google has been criticized on several different issues, including privacy. Specific criticism of Google Classroom generally focuses on concern for privacy for students and Google's use of student data.[24][better source needed] Criticism of Google Classroom is often combined with criticism of Chromebooks and G Suite.[citation needed]Other criticisms directed at Google classroom are lack of a full-fledged gradebook,[25][26] lack of automatic quizzes and tests (common features in learning management systems),[27] and editing of assignments once they are released.[28]Google has responded to concerns about privacy practices by stating \"Google is committed to building products that help protect student and teacher privacy and provide best-in-class security for your institution.\"[29]"

        "name": "Google Cloud Print",
        "text": "Google Cloud Print is a Google service that lets users print from any Cloud Print-aware application (web, desktop, mobile) on any device in the network cloud to any printer with native support for connecting to cloud print services[2] â without Google having to create and maintain printing subsystems for all the hardware combinations of client devices and printers, and without the users having to install device drivers to the client,[2] but with documents being fully transmitted to Google.[3] Since July 23, 2013 it also allows printing from any Windows application, if Google Cloud Printer[4] is installed on the machine.[5] In November 2019, Google announced that Google Cloud Print would be discontinued at the end of 2020.[6]Google Cloud Print integrates with the mobile versions of Gmail and Google Docs, allowing users to print from their mobile devices.[7] Google Cloud Print is listed as a printer option in the Print Preview page of Google's Web browser, Google Chrome, in Chrome 16 and higher.[8] Printers without built-in Cloud Print support, often referred to as \"legacy\" or \"classic\",[2][9] are supported through a \"Cloud Print Connector\" integrated with Google Chrome versions 9 and higher.[10]Google introduced Cloud Print in April 2010, as a future solution for printing from Chrome OS.[11] They made the design document and a preliminary version of the source code available.[12][13] Google Cloud Print reached beta stage on 25 January 2011.[14]Applications print through a web-based, common print dialog (web UI) or an API. The service forwards the job to a printer registered to the service. Cloud Ready printers (which connect directly to the web and do not require a computer to set up[2][9]) can directly connect to Google Cloud Print. As legacy (\"classic\") printers cannot accept input from a cloud service, Google Chrome 9 contained a \"Cloud Print Connector\"âwhich lets printers plugged into a Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac, or Linux computer with Internet access use Cloud Print while the connector is running in Google Chrome.[2][9][10]Printing through Google Cloud Print from any instance of Google Chrome was enabled in Google Chrome 16.[8]Since December 2014, Google Cloud Print lets users share printers[8] in a manner similar to Google Docs.[15]In July 2013, Google updated the service to allow printing from any Windows application if Google Cloud Printer[4] is installed on the machine.[5] The Google Cloud Print Service can run as a Windows service, so legacy printers can connect to Google Cloud Print.[5]Google Cloud Print 2.0, not supported by some printers that support v 1.0, adds support for a local mode similar in operation to Apple's AirPrint. Unlike the earlier version of Cloud Print, v 2.0 does not require either the printer or printing client to be connected to the Internet. Local mode uses a discovery protocol called Privet,[16] which uses Multicast DNS and DNS-SD for discovery, and HTTPS for transmitting print jobs to the printer. Clients supporting this mode only list printers that are discoverable on the same subnet the device is connected to, and forget the printers once disconnected from that subnet.[17]Google announced in November 2019 that Google Cloud Print would no longer be supported after December 31, 2020.[6] Google cited improvements in native Chrome OS printing as well as a marketplace of other print solutions providers in its decision to terminate the service.[18]Documents printed via Google Cloud Print are sent to Google's servers for transmission to the printer. Google explains, \"Google also keeps a copy of each document you send for printing - but only for so long as the printing job is active and not complete. We have to do this to make sure your document gets printed. Once the job is complete, the document is deleted from our servers...Documents you send to print are your personal information and are kept strictly confidential. Google does not access the documents you print for any purpose other than to improve printing.\"[3]"

It was announced at Google's developer conference on May 18, 2016, and began its worldwide release on August 16, 2016. It is also available to use via Google's Chrome browser on desktop and laptop computers.Google Duo lets users make video calls in high definition. It is optimized for low-bandwidth networks. End-to-end encryption is enabled by default. Duo is based on phone numbers, allowing users to call someone from their contact list. The app automatically switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks. A \"Knock Knock\" feature lets users see a live preview of the caller before answering. An update in April 2017 lets users worldwide make audio-only calls.In an email sent to Android phone manufacturers on October 5, 2016, Google announced that, starting December 1, 2016, Google Duo replaced Hangouts within the suite of Google apps Android phone makers must pre-install on devices, with Hangouts instead becoming an optional app for phone makers.[3]Google Duo video calls are in 720p HD video.[4] It is optimized for low-bandwidth mobile networks through WebRTC and uses QUIC over UDP. Optimization is further achieved through the degradation of video quality through monitoring network quality.[5] \"Knock Knock\" shows a live preview of the caller before the recipient picks up, which Google says is to \"make calls feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption\".[6] End-to-end encryption is enabled by default.[4] Duo is based on phone numbers, allowing users to call people from their contact list.[4] The app automatically switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks.[4]In March 2018, it was announced that Google Duo would let users make audio-only calls. The feature was first launched in Brazil,[7][8][9] with a global rollout in April.[10]A year later in March 2018, video and voice messages were added to Duo. Users can leave messages up to 30 seconds long for contacts who are unavailable. These messages can then be viewed by the other party, with the option of calling afterwards.[11]Support for eight-person video calls in both the iOS and Android versions of the app was added in May 2019.[12] In line with similar group calling offerings from FaceTime, WhatsApp, Skype and Facebook Messenger, participants can join or leave the conversation at any time."

Google Fi uses networks operated by Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular. Google Fi is a service for US residents only, as of late 2019.[1]The service was launched for the Nexus 6, by invitation only, on April 22, 2015. The service was opened to the public on March 7, 2016,[2] and support for additional devices, including the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, was introduced on October 4, 2016.[3] On November 28, 2018, Google rebranded Project Fi as Google Fi and added support for more phones, including iPhones.[4]Google Fi automatically switches between networks depending on signal strength and speed. It can automatically connect to Wi-Fi hotspots with encryption through an automatic VPN. Phone calls transition between Wi-Fi and cellular networks. With all networks combined, the service covers more than 170 countries around the world.A subscription costs $20 per month for unlimited calls and messaging, plus a customizable data allowance costing an additional $10 per gigabyte. Money for unused data is credited back to the user's account, and overuse of data costs an additional $10 per gigabyte.Google Fi currently offers a plan for current clients to share their own personal coupon code. Each referral code is worth $20 to the current client, and $20 for each new client signing up. A group plan costs an additional $15 per user per month, and offers features including data overview, data notifications, monthly allowances, and the ability to pause users' data usage. A data-only SIM card can be used on supported tablets, smartphones, and car modems (e.g., Volvo). A Data-only sim will have access to data, but will not be able to make calls or transmit texts across cellular networksGoogle Fi now offers an 'Unlimited' Plan for its users for a flat rate of $70 per month with up to 15GB of high speed data. After 15GB, speeds are throttled to 256KB/s. On both plans, users can pay an additional $10 per 1GB until their next billing cycle. [5]Google Fi was announced exclusively for the Nexus 6 smartphone on April 22, 2015, with support for Sprint and T-Mobile.[6][7][8][9] Due to high demand at launch, the service required that users receive invitations, which were gradually released throughout summer 2015.[10][11] The invitation system was dropped on March 7, 2016.[12][13][14] U.S. Cellular was added on June 8, 2016.[15][16][17] Three was added on July 12, 2016.[18][19][20] In October 2016, Google added support for the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones,[21][22] and later introduced a Group Plan, letting subscribers add extra members to their plans.[23][24][25]On January 17, 2018, Google Fi announced bill protection which caps the charge for data at $60. If the data used is greater than 15 GB, then Fi may slow the data speed to 256 kbps. The user can avoid the slowdown by paying full price for the data used at $10 per GB. Bill protection also works with group plans, with a maximum charge of $85 for two people, $120 for three people, and $140 for four people. The rate for unlimited calls and texting is not affected by bill protection.Google Fi automatically switches between networks depending on signal strength and speed.[26] It can automatically connect to open Wi-Fi hotspots while securing data with encryption through an automatic VPN.[27] Phone calls will seamlessly transition to a cellular network if Wi-Fi coverage is lost.[28][29][30][31]Google Fi users can use Google Hangouts on any phone, tablet, or computer to call and text.[32] Google Fi also supports VoLTE as part of a staged rollout.[33] With all of its networks combined, Google Fi's service covers more than 200 countries and territories around the world.[34]Monthly plans are flat feeâbased,[28] paid at the beginning of each monthly billing cycle. It starts at $20 per month for unlimited calls and messaging. Money for unused data is credited back to the user's account, while overuse of data results in a charge of $10 per gigabyte.[35] When outside the United States, cellular phone calls cost $0.20 per minute, data costs the same $10 per gigabyte (i.e. there are no extra data charges outside of the US), and texting is free.[36] Data is free at full speeds between 6GB to 15GB for the duration of the billing cycle with Bill Protection. After 15GB, data continues to be free but will be throttled to unspecified speeds. [37] A data-only SIM card can be used on tablets and other compatible devices, including the 2013 Nexus 7, Nexus 9, and iPad Air 2. The devices must be compatible with the T-Mobile network, and users can add up to 9 data-only SIM cards in one account.[38][39]A Group Plan, which allows users, referred to as \"managers\", to add other people, referred to as \"members\", to their subscription, costs an additional $15 per user. Group Plans let managers view data usage by member, set data notifications, add monthly allowances, and pause members' data usage.[23][24][25] In June 2017, Group Plans were updated to feature \"Group Repay\", in which Project Fi automatically calculates each of the members' individual shares of the bill and allows for easy payments. Such payments can be a fixed amount, an individual's total usage, or only for data usage above the standard data allotment.[40][41][42]Nicole Lee of Engadget praised the service's plans, writing that \"In the course of six months, I've barely touched my monthly 2 GB data allotment and frequently receive money back each month from unused data. I found myself paying a little more than $20 a month for Fi, which is the least I've paid for a cell phone service, ever.\" Lee liked the service's transition between Wi-Fi and cellular data.[44]JR Raphael of Computerworld also praised the pricing strategy and network transitions. Raphael also wrote that \"Fi's customer support is [...] actually a pretty good experience\", elaborating that \"if you need extra help, both interfaces offer the ability to get 24/7 support from a real person via phone or email.\"[45]"

        "name": "Google Groups",
        "text": "Google Groups is a service from Google that provides discussion groups for people sharing common interests. The Groups service also provides a gateway to Usenet newsgroups via a shared user interface.Google Groups became operational in February 2001, following Google's acquisition of Deja's Usenet archive. Deja News had been operational since March 1995.Google Groups allows any user to freely conduct and access threaded discussions, via either a web interface or e-mail. There are at least two kinds of discussion group. The first kind are forums specific to Google Groups, which act more like mailing lists.[2] The second kind are Usenet groups, accessible by NNTP, for which Google Groups acts as gateway and unofficial archive. The Google Groups archive of Usenet newsgroup postings dates back to 1981.[3] Through the Google Groups user interface, users can read and post to Usenet groups.[4]In addition to accessing Google and Usenet groups, registered users can also set up mailing list archives for e-mail lists that are hosted elsewhere.[5]The Deja News Research Service was an archive of messages posted to Usenet discussion groups, started in March 1995 by Steve Madere in Austin, Texas. Its powerful search engine capabilities won the service acclaim, generated controversy, and significantly changed the perceived nature of online discussion. This archive was acquired by Google in 2001.While archives of Usenet discussions had been kept for as long as the medium existed, Deja News offered a novel combination of features. It was available to the general public, provided a simple World Wide Web user interface, allowed searches across all archived newsgroups, returned immediate results, and retained messages indefinitely. The search facilities transformed Usenet from a loosely organized and ephemeral communication tool into a valued information repository. The archive's relative permanence, combined with the ability to search messages by author, raised concerns about privacy and confirmed oft-repeated past admonishments that posters should be cautious in discussing themselves and others.[6]While Madere was initially reluctant to remove archived material, protests from users and legal pressure led to the introduction of \"nuking\", a method for posters to permanently remove their own messages from search results. It already supported the use of an \"X-No-Archive\" message header, which if present would cause an article to be omitted from the archive. This did not prevent others from quoting the material in a later message and causing it to be stored. Copyright holders were also allowed to have material removed from the archive. According to Humphrey Marr of Deja News, copyright actions most frequently came from the Church of Scientology.[7]The capability to \"nuke\" postings was kept open for many years but later removed without explanation under Google's tenure. Google also mistakenly resurrected previously \"nuked\" messages at one point, angering many users.[8] \"Nukes\" that were in effect at the time when Google removed the possibility, are still honored, however. Since May 2014, European users can request to have search results for their name from Google Groups, including their Usenet archive, delinked under the right to be forgotten law. Google Groups is one of the ten most delinked sites.[9] If Google does not grant a delinking, Europeans can appeal to their local data protection agencies.[10]The service was eventually expanded beyond search. My Deja News offered the ability to read Usenet in the traditional chronological, per-group manner, and to post new messages to the network. Deja Communities were private Internet forums offered primarily to businesses. In 1999 the site (now known as Deja.com) sharply changed direction and made its primary feature a shopping comparison service. During this transition, which involved relocation of the servers, many older messages in the Usenet archive became unavailable. By late 2000 the company, in financial distress, sold the shopping service to eBay, who incorporated the technology into their half.com services.By 2001, the Deja search service was shut down. In February 2001, Google acquired Deja News and its archive, and transitioned its assets to groups.google.com.[11] Users were then able to access these Usenet newsgroups through the new Google Groups interface.By the end of 2001, the archive had been supplemented with other archived messages dating back to May 11, 1981.[12][13][14] These early posts from 1981â1991 were donated to Google by the University of Western Ontario, based on archives by Henry Spencer from the University of Toronto.[15] A short while later,[when?] Google released a new version that allowed users to create their own non-Usenet groups.When AOL discontinued access to Usenet around 2005, it recommended Google Groups instead.[16]In 2008, Google broke the Groups search functionality and left it nonfunctional for about a year, until a Wired article spurred the company to fix the problems.[17][18]For several years from May 2010 onward, Google incrementally changed the layout of the web search results pages, often degrading the discoverability of the site itself as well as its usability and functionality.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]On February 13, 2015, a Vice Media story reported that the ability to do advanced searches across all groups had again become nonfunctional, and to date, Google has neither fixed nor acknowledged the problem. The researcher interviewed stated, \"Advanced searches within specific groups appear to be working, but that's hardly useful for any form of researchâbe it casual or academic.\"[29]The late Lee Rizor, also known as Blinky the Shark,[30] started the Usenet Improvement Project,[31] a project which is highly critical of Google Groups and its users. The project aims to \"make Usenet participation a better experience\". They have accused Google Groups of ignoring an \"increasing wave of spam\" from its servers and of encouraging an Eternal September of \"lusers\" and \"lamers\" arriving in established groups en masse. The Usenet Improvement Project provides several killfile examples to block messages posted by Google Groups users in several newsreaders.Slashdot, Vice and Wired contributors have criticized Google for its unannounced discontinuation of the Google Groups Advanced Search page and the ability to perform advanced searches across all groups, leaving it nearly impossible to find postings without either knowing keywords from them that are unique across Google Groups' entire multi-decade archive of posts, or else knowing beforehand which newsgroup(s) they were posted in.[32][17][18][29] And other commentators have since noted that even many simple searches across all groups repeatably fail to return correct results.[26]Google Groups was blocked in Turkey on April 10, 2008 by the order of a court.[33] According to The Guardian, the court banned Google Groups following a libel complaint by Adnan Oktar against the service. Google Groups was the first of several websites to be blocked by the Turkish Government in rapid succession solely for including material that allegedly offended Islam.[34] The ban was removed a month later on May 15, 2008[35]"

Every Google Account starts with 15 gigabytes of free storage that is shared across Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos. Google One paid plans offer cloud storage starting at 100 gigabytes, up to a maximum of 30 terabytes.[2] Google One replaced the paid services of Google Drive to emphasize the fact that the program is used by multiple Google Services.[3] The program's raw storage is not accessible by users, but emails, files, and pictures can be added and removed through Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Photos.The storage managed by Google One is used by Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Photos. The same plans are slightly cheaper than the historical Google Drive plans. Google also removed their 1 terabyte plan and added a 200 gigabyte plan during the changeover, as well as reduced the price of the 2 terabyte plan from $19.99 per month to $9.99 per month.As of August 2019, these are the storage plans offered by Google:[4][5]Storage purchases renew automatically at the end of the subscription period. Users can upgrade their storage plan anytime, with the new storage tier taking effect immediately. Storage can also be shared with up to 5 family members, with each person getting the default 15 gigabytes. Files count towards the default storage before counting towards shared storage. Many items do not take up any space: Google Docs, Forms, Sheets, Sites, and Slides. Shared files or files in \"Shared with me\" only use up the owner's quota. Photos and videos using the \"High Quality\" setting do not take up any space, but may be a lower quality than the original version. Google Pixel phones allow users to back up an unlimited number of videos and photos that don't count towards the quota.[6][7] Users of the Google One service also see an addition to their account's avatar icon of a four-color circular surround made up of the company's blue-red-yellow-green color, scheme to denote their status.Google announced Google One in May 2018. They announced that the 1 terabyte plan for Google Drive would be upgraded to 2 terabytes, while the 2 terabytes plan's price would be the same price as Google Drive's 1 terabyte plan (US$9.99). Google also announced that 24/7 support would be available with all Google One plans.[2] From May to August 2018, Google began upgrading Google Drive users to Google One, with Google Drive's 1 terabyte plan being upgraded to 2 terabytes. On August 15, 2018, Google announced that new users can get Google One in the United States.[1]Users with a paid plan are able to get support from \"Google experts\", for all of Google services. The support is open 24/7 and is available over chat, email, and phone.[2] Google also offers Google Play credits, hotel discounts, and benefits from other Google services for users who have one of the paid plans. Google has also added family member support, allowing for up to 5 family members to share one shared plan while still retaining their free 15 gigabytes.[8]"

        "text": "Google Pay (stylized as G Pay; formerly Pay with Google and Android Pay) is a digital wallet platform and online payment system developed by Google to power in-app and tap-to-pay purchases on mobile devices, enabling users to make payments with Android phones, tablets or watches.As of January 8, 2018, the old Android Pay and Google Wallet have unified into a single pay system called Google Pay.[3] Android Pay was rebranded and renamed as Google Pay. It also took over the branding of Google Chrome's autofill feature.[4] Google Pay adopts the features of both Android Pay and Google Wallet through its in-store, peer-to-peer, and online payments services.[5][3]The rebranded service provided a new API that allows merchants to add the payment service to websites, apps, Stripe, Braintree, and Google Assistant.[6] The service allows users to use the payment cards they have on file with Google Play.[7]The Google Pay app also added support for boarding passes and event tickets in May 2018.[8]Google Pay uses Near Field Communication (NFC) to transmit card information facilitating funds transfer to the retailer. It replaces the credit or debit card chip and PIN or magnetic stripe transaction at point-of-sale terminals by allowing the user to upload these in the Google Pay wallet. It is similar to contactless payments already used in many countries, with the addition of two-factor authentication. The service lets Android devices wirelessly communicate with point of sale systems using a near field communication (NFC) antenna, host-based card emulation (HCE), and Android's security.Google Pay takes advantage of physical authentications such as fingerprint ID where available. On devices without fingerprint ID, Google Pay is activated with a passcode. When the user makes a payment to a merchant, Google Pay does not send the credit or debit card number with the payment. Instead it generates a virtual account number representing the user's account information. This service keeps customer payment information private, sending a one-time security code instead of the card or user details.[9]Google Pay requires that a screen lock be set on the phone.[10] It has no card limit.[11][12][13]Users can add payment cards to the service by taking a photo of the card, or by entering the card information manually. To pay at points of sale, users hold their authenticated device to the point of sale system. The service has smart-authentication, allowing the system to detect when the device is considered secure (for instance if unlocked in the last five minutes) and challenge if necessary for unlock information.[14] Spring CEO Alan Tisch said Google Pay improves mobile shopping business by supporting a \"buy button\" powered by Google Pay integrated within vendor's creative design.[15]Originally launched as Android Pay, the service was released at Google I/O 2015. Android Pay was a successor to and built on the base established by Google Wallet which was released in 2011.[16] It also used technology from the carrier-backed SoftcardâGoogle had acquired its intellectual property in February 2015.[9][17] At launch, the service was compatible with 70% of Android devices, and was accepted at over 700,000 merchants.[9] Google Wallet still powered web-based Play Store purchases and some app-based peer-to-peer payments, for instance in Gmail.[9]As of 2017, it is currently available in the United States, Canada, Brazil, UK, Ireland, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.[18] Upon its UK launch Android Pay supported MasterCard and Visa credit and debit cards from many of the UK's major financial institutions â including Bank of Scotland, First Direct, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, M&S Bank, MBNA and Nationwide Building Society â \"with new banks being added all the time\" according to Google. Natwest, RBS and Ulster Bank will launch on September 14. On September 8, 2016 it was reported that UK banks TSB and Santander will participate \"over the coming weeks\".[19] Android Pay was launched in Singapore on June 28, 2016,[20] and in Australia on July 14, 2016.[21][22] Android Pay launched in the Republic of Ireland on December 7, 2016 and is initially available to customers of AIB and KBC. The service works with both credit and debit cards.[23]In 2016, Google began a public trial in Silicon Valley of a related mobile app called Hands Free. In this system, the customer does not need to present a phone or card. Instead, a customer announces they wish to \"pay with Google\" and give their initials to the cashier, who verifies their identity with a photo previously uploaded to the system. The customer's phone will only authorize payment if its geographic location system indicates it is near a participating store.[24][25]On September 18, 2017, Google launched an UPI-based app Tez in India.[26] On August 28, 2018, Google rebranded Tez to Google Pay.[27]On January 8, 2018, Google announced that Google Wallet would be merged into Android Pay, with the service as a whole rebranded as Google Pay.[28] This merger extends the platform into web-based payments integrated into other Google and third-party services. The rebranding began to roll out as an update to the Android Pay app on February 20, 2018; the app was given an updated design, and now displays a personalized list of nearby stores which support Google Pay.[29][30][31]On December 21, 2018, Google Payment, obtained an e-money license in Lithuania - the license will enable Google to process payments, issue e-money, and handle electronic money wallets in the EU. [32][33]Those on light yellow background: originally released as Android Pay.On watches, Google Pay is available only in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States.[72]"

        "name": "Google Photos",
        "text": "Google Photos is a photo sharing and storage service developed by Google. It was announced in May 2015 and separated from Google+, the company's social network.Google Photos gives users free, unlimited storage for photos up to 16 megapixels and videos up to 1080p resolution. The service automatically analyzes photos, identifying various visual features and subjects. Users can search for anything in photos, with the service returning results from three major categories: People, Places, and Things. Google Photos recognizes faces, grouping similar ones together (this feature is only available in certain countries due to privacy laws); geographic landmarks (such as the Eiffel Tower); and subject matter, including birthdays, buildings, animals, food, and more.Different forms of machine learning in the Photos service allow recognition of photo contents, automatically generate albums, animate similar photos into quick videos, surface past memories at significant times, and improve the quality of photos and videos. In May 2017, Google announced several updates to Google Photos, including reminders for and suggested sharing of photos, shared photo libraries between two users, and physical albums, with Photos automatically suggesting collections based on face, location, trip, or other distinction.Google Photos acts as a back up when photos are sent or in Google terms 'Shared'. This is just a common backup tool when photos are shared between social media or other platforms or apps.Google Photos received critical acclaim after its decoupling from Google+ in 2015. Reviewers liked the updated Photos service for its recognition technology, search, apps, and loading times. Nevertheless, privacy concerns were raised, including Google's motivation for building the service, as well as its relationship to governments and possible laws requiring Google to hand over a user's entire photo history. Google Photos has seen strong user adoption. It reached 100 million users after five months, 200 million after one year, and 500 million as of May 2017, with Google announcing that over 1.2 billion photos are uploaded to the service every day, with the grand total of all uploaded content measuring over 13.7 petabytes of storage. For comparison, at the end of 2017, the entire Internet Archive held almost 40 petabytes.[4]In 2019, Google Photos reached 1 billion users mark.[5]The service has apps for the Android and iOS operating systems, and a website.[6] Users back up their photos to the cloud service, which become accessible for all of their devices.[7]The Photos service analyzes and organizes images into groups and can identify features such as beaches, skylines, or \"snowstorm in Toronto\".[6] From the application's search window, users are shown potential searches for groups of photos in three major categories: People, Places, and Things.[7] The service analyzes photos for similar faces and groups them together in the People category.[7] It can also track faces as they age.[6] The Places category uses geotagging data but can also determine locations in older pictures by analyzing for major landmarks (e.g., photos containing the Eiffel Tower).[7] The Things category processes photos for their subject matter: birthdays, buildings, cats, concerts, food, graduations, posters, screenshots, etc. Users can manually remove categorization errors.[7]Recipients of shared images can view web galleries without needing to download the app.[6] Users can swipe their fingers across the screen to adjust the service's photo editing settings, as opposed to using sliders.[8] Images can be easily shared with social networks (Google+, Facebook, Twitter) and other services. The application generates web links that both Google Photos users and non-users can access.[7]Google Photos has two storage settings: \"High quality\" and \"Original quality\". High quality includes unlimited photo and video storage for photos up to 16 megapixels and videos up to 1080p resolution (the maximum resolutions for average smartphone users in 2015).[7] Original quality preserves the original resolution and quality of the photos and videos, but uses storage quantity in the users' Google account.[9]For the Google Pixel 1-3 phones, Google Photos offers unlimited storage at \"Original quality\" for free.[10][11] The original Pixel had no limits to this offer, while the Pixel 2 and 3 only offered unlimited storage at \"Original quality\" for photos and videos taken before January 16, 2021 and January 31, 2022 respectively, with all photos and videos taken after those dates being uploaded at \"High quality\" instead. The Pixel 3a and onwards do not offer unlimited storage at \"Original quality\"[12], with the Pixel 4 offering a 3-month trial for the 100GB Google One plan to new members instead.[13]In December 2015, Google added shared albums to Google Photos. Users pool photos and videos into an album, and then share the album with other Google Photos users. The recipient \"can join to add their own photos and videos, and also get notifications when new pics are added\". Users can also save photos and videos from shared albums to add them to their own, private collection.[14][15][16] Unlike the native Photos service within iOS, Google Photos permits full resolution sharing across Android and iOS platforms and between the two.In June 2016, Google updated Photos to include automatically generated albums. After an event or trip, Photos will group the best photos together and suggest creating an album with them, alongside maps to show geographic travel and location pins for exact places. Users can also add text captions to describe photos.[17][18] In October, Google announced multiple significant updates; Google Photos will now surface old memories with people identified in users' recent photos; it will occasionally highlight the best photos when a user has recently taken a lot of images of a specific subject; it will now make animations from videos as well as photos (photo animations have been present since the start), displaying the most memorable moments in videos; and it will now find all sideways photos and help the user easily flip them to normal orientation. For all of these features, Google touts machine learning does the work, with no user interaction required.[19] In November, Google released a separate app - PhotoScan - for users to scan printed photos into the service. The app, released for iOS and Android, uses a scanning process in which users must center their camera over four dots that overlay the printed image, so that the software can combine the photographs for a high resolution digital image with fewest possible defects.[20][21] Later that month, Google added a \"Deep blue\" slider feature that lets users change the color and saturation of skies, without degrading image quality or inadvertently changing colors of other objects or elements in photos.[22]In February 2017, Google updated the \"Albums\" tab on the Android app to include three separate sections; one for the phone's camera roll, with different views for sorting options (such as people or location); another for photos taken inside other apps; and a third for the actual photo albums.[23][24] In March, Google added an automatic white balance feature to the service. The Android app and website were the first to receive the feature, with later rollout to the iOS app.[25][26] Later in March, updates to the service enabled uploading of photos in a \"lightweight preview\" quality for immediate viewing on slow cellular networks before a higher-quality upload later while on faster Wi-Fi. The feature also extends to sharing photos, in which a low-resolution image will be sent before being updated with a higher-quality version.[27][28] In April, Google added video stabilization. The feature creates a duplicate video to avoid overwriting the original clip.[29][30]In May 2017, Google announced several updates to Google Photos. \"Suggested Sharing\" reminds users to share captured photos after the fact, and also groups photos based on faces and suggests recipients based on facial recognition. \"Shared Libraries\" lets two users share a central repository for all photos or specific categories of images. \"Photo Books\" are physical collections of photos, offered either as softcover or hardcover albums, with Photos automatically suggesting collections based on face, location, trip, or other distinction.[31][32][33] Towards the end of the month, Google introduced an \"Archive\" feature that lets users hide photos from the main timeline view without deleting them. Archived content still appears in relevant albums and in search.[34][35] In June, the new sharing features announced in May began rolling out to users.[36][37]In December 2018, Google doubled the number of photos and videos users can store in a private Google Photos Live Album. The number increased from 10,000 to 20,000 photos, which is equivalent to the capacity for shared albums.[38]In September 2019, Google Photos was to get its own version of social media stories[disambiguation needed], called \"Memories\". Instead of capturing the current moment, Memories will highlight past photos to give their users a nostalgic feeling.[39]Google Photos is the standalone successor to the photo features previously embedded in Google+, the company's social network.[6] Google launched the social network to compete with Facebook, but the service never became as popular and Facebook remained the Internet's preferred website for social networking and photo sharing. Google+, however, offered photo storage and organizational tools that surpassed Facebook's in power, though Google+ lacked the user base to use it.[8] By leaving the social network affiliation, the Photos service changed its association from a sharing platform to a private library platform.[7]On February 12, 2016, Google announced that the Picasa desktop application would be discontinued on March 15, 2016, followed by the closure of the Picasa Web Albums service on May 1, 2016. Google stated that the primary reason for retiring Picasa was that it wanted to focus its efforts \"entirely on a single photo service\"; the cross-platform, web-based Google Photos.[40]In October 2015, five months after the launch of the service, Google announced that Google Photos had 100 million users, who had uploaded 3.72 petabytes of photos and videos.[41][42][43]In May 2016, one year after the release of Google Photos, Google announced the service had over 200 million monthly active users. Other statistics it revealed was at least 13.7 petabytes of photos/videos had been uploaded, 2 trillion labels had been applied (24 billion of those being selfies), and 1.6 billion animations, collages and effects had been created based on user content.[44]In May 2017, Google announced that Google Photos has over 500 million users,[45] who upload over 1.2 billion photos every day.[46]At the May 2015 release of Google Photos, reviewers wrote that the service was among the best of its kind.[7][47] Walt Mossberg of Recode declared the service the best in cloud photo storage, against its competition from Amazon (Amazon Drive), Apple (iCloud), Dropbox, and Microsoft (OneDrive).[7] Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge wrote that the release made Google a major competitor in the photo storage market,[6] and that its pricing structure obsoleted the idea of paying for photo storage.[8] Sarah Mitroff and Lynn La of CNET wrote that the service's phone and tablet apps were particularly good, and that Google Photos had a more streamlined design than Yahoo's Flickr and more organizing features than Apple's iCloud photo service.[47]Kastrenakes described the service's May 2015 release as evidence that Google was spinning out the \"best features\" of its Google+ social network. He stated that the Photos service was \"always excellent\", and liked that users would be able to use the service \"without signing up for a new social network\".[6] Mossberg described the release as \"liberation day\" for the photos features that were \"effectively hidden\" in the \"widely ignored social network\".[7] The service's strategy, as described by Josh Lowensohn of The Verge, was to put all data on Google's servers so that it can be accessed universally.[8]Mossberg liked the service's search function, writing that a search for \"Massachusetts\" \"instantly brought up loads of photos of subjects\".[7] Lowensohn noted the service's speed and intelligence, especially in its ability to sort unorganized photos, as well as its photo loading times, search speeds, and simple photo editing tools.[8] Kastrenakes compared the service's new image analysis to technology unveiled by Flickr earlier in the same month.[6] Mossberg thought the face grouping feature was \"remarkably accurate\", but was most impressed by the subject-based grouping. He was surprised that a search for \"boats\" found both Cape Cod fishing boats and Venetian gondolas, but also noted errors such as a professional photograph registering as a screenshot.[7]PC Magazine's John C. Dvorak was concerned about the service's privacy. He was particularly concerned about Google's motivation for building the service, the company's relationships with existing governments, and potential laws that would require Google to provide a user's entire history of photos upon request. Dvorak compared such a scenario to inviting others to \"scrounge through your underwear drawer\". He criticized the service's sync functions, and preferred folders of images over an unsorted \"flat database\". Dvorak also highlighted the service's poor choice of photos to animate and lack of longevity guarantees, considering the company's abrupt cancellation of Google Reader. He ultimately suggested that users instead use a portable hard drive, which he considered safer and cheap.[48]"

        "name": "Google Play Books",
        "text": "Google Play Books, formerly Google eBooks, is an ebook digital distribution service operated by Google, part of its Google Play product line. Users can purchase and download ebooks and audiobooks from Google Play, which offers over five million titles, with Google claiming it to be the \"largest ebooks collection in the world\". Books can be read on a dedicated Books section on the Google Play website, through the use of a mobile app available for Android and iOS, through the use of select e-readers that offer support for Adobe Digital Editions, through a web browser and reading via Google Home. Users may also upload up to 1,000 ebooks in the PDF or EPUB file formats. Google Play Books is available in 75 countries.Google Play Books was launched in December 2010, with a reseller program letting independent booksellers sell Google ebooks on their websites for a cut of sales. It also launched an affiliate program in June 2011, allowing website owners to earn a commission by referring sales to the then-named Google eBookstore. However, the reseller program ended in April 2012, with Google stating that it had \"not gained the traction that we hoped it would\" and \"not met the needs of many readers or booksellers\". The affiliate program closed for new signups in February 2012, with Google announcing that it would scale down the initiative, making it private and invitation-only.The mobile Android app has seen several significant updates since its introduction, including different reading modes with color contrasts, support for text highlighting and note-taking, a zoomed-out view with easy page sliding in an effort to improve reading experiences for books not read cover-to-cover, a vertical scrolling mode for comic books, a \"Night Light\" feature that gradually filters blue light to reduce eye strain after sunset, using machine learning imaging technologies to expand speech bubbles in comics, and listening to audiobooks.Play Books store has been noted to hold a lot of pirated content, which led Google to discontinue new sign-ups to its publisher program in 2015. The program was reopened only in 2018 when it incorporated an automated process to decline books found to contain extensive text copied from other books already in the store.The history of Google Play Books can be traced to the Google eBooks service offered by Google before the Google Play brand came into existence. The Google eBookstore was launched on December 6, 2010, with more than three million titles available, making it the \"largest ebooks collection in the world\".[3] At the time of launch, the service was partnered with 100 independent booksellers, while the number of publishers was 5,000. This increased to 250 independent booksellers and 7,000 publishers in May 2011, along with three million free Google eBooks available in the United States, up from two million at launch.[4][5] The service was codenamed Google Editions, the name under which it was widely assumed that the service would be launched.[6] Google Books director Dan Clancy had talked about Google's vision to open an ebookstore for in-print books in an interview back in July 2009.[7] Then-named TechHive reported in October 2009 that the service would be launched in the first half of 2010,[8] before a Google employee told the media in May that the launch would be in June or July.[9][10] The actual launch, however, took place in December.[3][11]The store was headed by Dan Clancy, who also directed Google Books. Clancy stated that Google Editions would let publishers set the prices for their books and would accept the 'agency' model, as that of the publisher being considered the seller with the online vendor acting as an 'agent'. Clancy also stressed that Google's ebooks would be readable on any device, indicating the open nature of the platform. It would also make ebooks available for bookstores to sell, giving \"the vast majority\" of revenues to the store. Having already digitized 12  million physical books at the time, including out-of-print titles, Google offered a \"far greater\" selection than Amazon and Apple did.[12]In June 2011, Google introduced an affiliate program for ebooks, allowing websites to earn commissions by referring sales to the Google eBookstore. Google eBooks became listed on the Google Affiliate Network.[13][14]In March 2012, Google revamped all of its digital distribution services into a single platform called Google Play, with the Google eBookstore becoming Google Play Books.[15][16][17]In April 2012, Google announced that its reseller partner program would be discontinued by the end of January 2013.[18]In July 2013, Google made some changes to the publisher policy page for Google Play Books, removing mentions of book bundle pricing, and adding several mentions of ebook rentals. Google also dropped support for a wide variety of ebook file formats it used to accept, including DOC, XML, HTML, MOBI and PDB, to focus primarily on the EPUB format.[19]In early May 2015, Google announced that a new custom-made typeface called Literata would be used for Google Play Books.[20][21]Towards the end of the month, Google announced that it was temporarily closing its Books Partner Center for new signups, stating that it was to \"improve our content management capabilities and our user experience.\"[22] This was presumably in response to the observations of extensive piracy on the ebookstore reported by The Digital Reader. However, it continued to remain closed for a long time, leading The Digital Reader to speculate that the closure would be permanent, commenting that \"Google has only a minimal interest in ebooks.\"[23] During this time, the only way author and publishers could get their content on to the store was through aggregators,[24] such as PublishDrive, ebookpartnership and StreetLib.[25]In September 2015, Google acquired Oyster, a subscription-based ebook service.[26][27] As a part of the acquisition, Oyster shut down its existing service in early 2016, and its founders joined Google Play Books in New York.[28]In January 2018, Google began selling audiobooks that can be listened via the app.[29]In June 2018, Google reopened its publisher program to new sign-ups. To curb piracy, text of new books would now compared with that of other books in the store.[30]At launch, Google had formed partnerships with independent booksellers, enabling them to sell Google ebooks on their websites for a cut of sales. Bookstore partners included Powell's, Alibris and participating members of the American Booksellers Association.[3]In a blog post in May 2011, Google announced that it had over 250 independent bookseller partners, compared to just over 100 at the time of launch.[4]In April 2012, Google decided to end the reseller program, stating that the program \"has not gained the traction that we hoped it would\" and that \"it's clear that the reseller program has not met the needs of many readers or booksellers\". The program was discontinued at the end of January 2013.[18] As noted by Publishers Weekly, the service \"sought to bring independent retailers into the digital retailing\", by giving local bookstores a fee from each title purchased by consumers, but local stores were required to do their own marketing and promotion, something that \"many stores simply did not have the resources to do\".[31] Seen as a \"big blow for small bookstores seeking to compete against Amazon and Barnes & Noble\", the move attracted severe criticism from the industry. In a letter to its members, the American Booksellers Association said that it was \"very disappointed\" in Google's decision while noting that the change could be \"disconcerting and disruptive\" for booksellers. \"As an enormous, multinational corporation, Google has interests far beyond independent bookstores, and the book world at large, and, at times, it has lacked understanding of many basic principles of our industry\", the letter said.[32]In June 2011, Google launched an affiliate program for Google eBooks, allowing website owners to earn a commission by referring sales to the Google eBookstore. Google had previously tested the program as a limited beta in December 2010 with Goodreads.[13] Becoming an affiliate was described by Gigaom as a three-step process: users first had to sign up for an AdSense account and be approved, then join the Google Affiliate Network and be approved, and then sign up as an affiliate for ebooks. Website owners could earn between 6-10% of a book's selling price, depending on the number of book sales through affiliate referrals.[14]In February 2012, Google announced its decision to scale down the affiliate program, turning it into a private initiative and removing most of the affiliates. Google eBooks would no longer be listed as an advertiser on the Google Affiliate Network.[33] Google had previously stopped accepting new applications for becoming an affiliate more than two weeks prior to the announcement.[34]Those who were delinked from the program received commissions for sales up to March 15, 2012. Google said that it would continue to add affiliates, but only on an invitation-basis.[35] In a mistake, Google also notified independent booksellers that their affiliate status would expire, but later clarified that it did not intend to remove independent booksellers from the affiliate program, and said that it was \"working to reinstate those who were mistakenly notified.\"[36]In May 2015, The Digital Reader reported its findings of extensive piracy prevailing on the Play Books store. Website writer Nate Hoffelder noted that there were several e-book pirates selling non-authentic copies of e-books at reduced prices. They were of inferior quality, with \"missing formatting, generic or outdated covers, and other problems\".[37] One day later, The Digital Reader reported that Google had removed the pirated book listings in response to the article, but deemed it far from enough.[38]Books purchased can be read on a dedicated Books section of the Google Play website, through the mobile app available for Android and iOS devices, and through the use of a Google Chrome web browser app.[39] Offline download and reading is supported on the mobile apps and through the Chrome web browser app.[40]At launch, introductory features included customizations such as selecting font, font size, line spacing, and day/night reading modes, and the ability to pick up reading positions while using multiple devices.[3] On Android, the app's home screen shows recently opened books, as well as book recommendations and books +1'd by friends.[41] The \"My Library\" section shows all the books grouped into three categories: \"Purchases\", \"Samples\" and \"Uploads\". Books can be \"kept on device\" for offline reading. Play Books features a 3D page turning effect, with an option to turn it off. It also allows users to turn pages using the device's volume controls.[42] The website interface does not support different reading modes or any page turning effect.[41] Text can be read out loud using the device's text-to-speech engine or Google Text-to-Speech, with an option for \"High-quality voice\" in settings, although the feature requires a data connection to stream the voice data.[41]In September 2012, Google Play Books on Android was updated to feature a new sepia reading mode, in addition to day and night modes; info cards for unknown written geographical locations and dictionary definitions; word or phrase translation; and support for highlighting text and writing notes.[43] The sepia reading mode, text highlighting and note-taking features were eventually extended to the iOS app in August 2013.[44]In May 2013, Play Books started allowing users to upload PDF and EPUB files for free through the Play Books website, with support for up to 1,000 files.[45][46] The Android app was updated in December 2013 with support for uploading files.[47][48]In October 2014, Play Books was updated to allow users to tap the center of the screen to enter a \"skim\" mode, where the page zooms out to allow users to easily slide between pages, in an effort to improve the reading experience for books that are typically not read cover to cover, such as non-fiction, cookbooks and textbooks.[49][50]In November 2015, Play Books was updated with features aimed at comic book fans, with the update adding a new vertical scrolling experience for comics in landscape mode, and new curated pages and recommendations for comics, with options for organizing by issue and volume.[51][52]In December 2015, Play Books was updated to include a \"Night Light\" feature that \"gradually filters blue light from your screen, replacing it with a warm, amber light as the sun sets\". Google claims that Night Light \"automatically adapts to the amount of natural sunlight outside based on the time of day, giving you just the right temperature and brightness\".[53][54]In July 2016, Play Books was updated with \"Bubble Zoom\", a machine learning imaging feature that recognizes objects in comics and \"expands the speech bubbles of a comic one-tap-at-a-time, making them super easy to read on your mobile device\".[55][56]The Google Play store serves as the primary source of ebooks for reading on Google Play Books. As of 2013, over five million titles are available.[57]Select books, mainly textbooks, are available for rental. The rental period starts as soon as the payment is completed, not when the book is opened.[58] Google Play also allows users to pre-order ebooks to have the title delivered automatically as soon as it's made available.[59]Originally, Google allowed publishers and authors to upload books in a number of formats, including DOC, PDF, PDB, MOBI, EPUB, and HTML. But in July 2013, support for all these formats except for PDF and EPUB were dropped.[19] As of 2017, Google accepts EPUB versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1. Both text and image-based PDFs are accepted when the EPUB format is not available, with the preference being for PDFs with a text layer.[60]For reading on e-readers or third-party apps, some ebooks, but not all,[61] can be downloaded in the EPUB (\"flowing text\") or PDF (\"original pages\") formats. Google states on its support pages that the advantage EPUB has over PDF is that it allows the book's text to adjust to different screen sizes, and offers smaller file sizes.[62]Publishers have the option to enable digital rights management (DRM) protection for the digital file download of ebooks. The DRM system used is the Adobe Content Server 4.[63] E-readers are required to support Adobe Digital Editions, and Google notes on its support pages that \"Books bought on Google Play won't work on Amazon Kindle devices.\"[61]Purchase of books from Google Play is currently supported in 75 countries. The full country list includes: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, and Vietnam.[64]Google Play Books was launched Mexico in March 2013;[65] Austria, Belgium, Ireland, and Portugal in June 2013;[66] South Africa, Switzerland, and Turkey in November 2013;[67] Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela in December 2013;[68] Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan in November 2014;[69] Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine in September 2014,[70] and Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates in January 2016.[71]In a December 2010 review, Laura Miller of Salon wrote that the public domain titles on the Google eBookstore were of a \"lesser quality\" than on competing services, writing that some titles \"had obviously not been proofed and the scans of the original pages were difficult to read\". Despite that, Miller found it interesting that public domain titles had functionality to view them either as a \"scanned version - with the original type, page numbering and even library stamps and marginalia, basically photographs of the printed pages\" and also as \"searchable \"flowing text,\" rendered by optical character recognition\". Miller also wrote that the eBookstore was not easy to search, \"an irony considering that the Google empire was built on search\". She criticized the user interface for being \"poor\" and seemingly \"devised by people who know next to nothing about the book trade\". She praised Google's decision to incorporate reader reviews from Goodreads, writing that it \"helps, as these are often more thoughtful than the average Amazon reader review\", though again criticizing the \"related books\" section for bad suggestions. She also praised that Google had formed partnerships with independent bookstores, writing that it is \"a great way to support neighborhood bookstores and it also allows Google eBookstore customers to partake of the expertise of people whose life's work is connecting readers with the right books.\"[72]In a May 2014 review, Riley Dennis of MakeUseOf wrote that \"Google Play has been expanding its reach to all forms of media recently, and Play Books is one section that has noticeably improved and is now a genuine contender to the eReading competition\". Dennis praised the ability to upload personal ebooks in addition to buying them, writing that it makes Play Books \"a great universal eReader\". Furthermore, he complimented the mobile Android app, writing that \"Play Books is a delight to read on, from the refreshingly simple interface to the customizable and smooth reading experience\", and that the page-turning animation was \"delightful\", \"realistic\" and \"smooth\". While writing about different forms of customization options available, he noted that \"the margins can't be changed\", and also criticized the website interface for lacking several features that were present in the mobile app. Dennis concluded his review by writing: \"Play Books is a solid eReading app, but it still has room for growth.\"[41]"

        "text": "Google Play Music is a music and podcast streaming service and online music locker operated by Google, part of its Google Play line of services. The service was announced on May 10, 2011, and after a six-month, invitation-only beta period, it was publicly launched on November 16, 2011.Users with standard accounts can upload and listen to up to 50,000 songs from their personal libraries at no cost. A paid Google Play Music subscription entitles users to on-demand streaming of any song in the Google Play Music catalog, as well as access to YouTube Music Premium. Users in several territories also have access to YouTube Premium. Users can purchase additional tracks for their library through the music store section of Google Play. In addition to offering music streaming for Internet-connected devices, the Google Play Music mobile apps allow music to be stored and listened to offline.Google Play Music offers all users storage of up to 50,000 files for free.[1][2] Users can listen to songs through the service's web player and mobile apps.[3] The service scans the user's collection and matches the files to tracks in Google's catalog, which can then be streamed or downloaded in up to 320 kbit/s quality.[4][5] Any files that are not matched are uploaded to Google's servers for streaming or re-download. Songs purchased through the Google Play Store do not count against the 50,000-song upload limit.[6]Supported file formats for upload include: MP3, AAC, WMA, FLAC, Ogg, or ALAC. Non-MP3 uploads will be converted to MP3. Files can be up to 300 MB after conversion.[7]Songs can be downloaded on the mobile apps for offline playback, and on computers through the Music Manager app.[8]Standard users located in the United States, Canada, and India can also listen to curated radio stations, supported by video and banner advertisements. Stations are based on \"an activity, your mood, or your favorite popular music\".[9] Up to six songs per hour can be skipped when listening to curated radio.[3]With a paid subscription to Google Play Music,[10] in addition to the standard features users get access to on-demand streaming of 40 million songs,[11] without advertisements during listening, no limit on number of skips, and offline music playback on the mobile apps.[3] A one-time 30-day free trial for a subscription to Google Play Music is offered for new users.[12] Paid subscribers also receive access to YouTube Premium (including YouTube Music) in eligible countries.[13]On computers, music can be listened to from a dedicated Google Play Music section of the Google Play website.[14]On smartphones and tablets, music can be listened to through the Google Play Music mobile app for the Android[15] and iOS operating systems.[16] Up to five smartphones can be used to access the library in Google Play Music, and up to ten devices total. Listening is limited to one device at a time.[17]In April 2017, reports surfaced that the default music player on the then-new Samsung Galaxy S8 would be Google Play Music, continuing a trend that started with the S7 in 2016. However, for the S8, Samsung partnered with Google to incorporate additional exclusive features into the app, including the ability to upload up to 100,000 tracks, an increase from the 50,000 tracks users are normally allowed to upload. Google also stated that it would develop other \"special features in Google Play Music just for Samsung customers\".[18][19] In June, Google Play Music on the S8 was updated to exclusively feature \"New Release Radio\", a daily, personalized playlist of new music releases.[20][21] In July, the playlist was made available to all users,[22][23] with Google noting in a press release that the exclusivity on Samsung devices was part of an \"early access program\" for testing and feedback purposes.[24]Google first hinted at releasing a cloud media player during their 2010 Google I/O developer conference, when Google's then-Senior Vice President of Social Vic Gundotra showed a \"Music\" section of the then-called Android Market during a presentation.[25] A music service was officially announced at the following year's I/O conference on May 10, 2011, under the name \"Music Beta\". Initially, it was only available by invitation to residents of the United States, and had limited functionality; the service featured a no-cost \"music locker\" for storage of up to 20,000 songs, but no music store was present during the beta period, as Google was not yet able to reach licensing deals with major record labels.[26][27]After a six-month beta period, Google publicly launched the service in the US on November 16, 2011, as \"Google Music\" with its \"These Go to Eleven\" announcement event. The event introduced several features of the service, including a music store integrated into the then-named Android Market, music sharing via the Google+ social network, \"Artist Hub\" pages for musicians to self-publish music, and song purchasing reflected on T-Mobile phone bills.[28][29][30] At launch, Google had partnerships with three major labels - Universal Music Group, EMI, and Sony Music Entertainment - along with other, smaller labels, although no agreement had been reached with Warner Music Group; in total, 13 million tracks were covered by these deals, 8 million of which were available for purchase on launch date.[31] To promote the launch, several artists released free songs and exclusive albums through the store; The Rolling Stones debuted the live recording Brussels Affair (Live 1973), and Pearl Jam released a live concert recorded in Toronto as 9.11.2011 Toronto, Canada.[32]In January 2012, a feature was added to Google Music that allows users to download 320kbit/s MP3 copies of any file in their library, with a two-download limit per track via the web, or unlimited downloads via the Music Manager app.[33]According to a February 2012 report from CNET, Google executives were displeased with Google Music's adoption rate and revenues in its first three months.[34]In March 2012, the company rebranded the Android Market and its digital content services as \"Google Play\"; the music service was renamed \"Google Play Music\".[35][36]Google announced in October 2012 that they had signed deals with Warner Music Group that would bring \"their full music catalog\" to the service.[37]At the Google I/O developer conference in May 2013, Google announced that Google Play Music would be expanded to include a paid on-demand music streaming service called \"All Access\", allowing users to stream any song in the Google Play catalog. It debuted immediately in the United States for $9.99 per month ($7.99 per month if the users signed up before June 30). The service allows users to combine the All Access catalog with their own library of songs.[38][39]Google Play Music was one of the first four apps compatible with Google's Chromecast digital media player that launched in July 2013.[40]In October 2014, a new \"Listen Now\" feature was introduced, providing contextual and curated recommendations and playlists. The feature was adapted from technology by Songza, which Google acquired earlier in the year.[41]On November 12, 2014, Google subsidiary YouTube announced \"Music Key\", a new premium service succeeding All Access that included the Google Play Music streaming service, along with advertising-free access to streaming music videos on YouTube. Additionally, aspects of the two platforms were integrated; Google Play Music recommendations and YouTube music videos are available across both services.[42][43] The service was re-launched in a revised form as YouTube Red (now YouTube Premium) on October 28, 2015, expanding its scope to offer ad-free access to all YouTube videos, as opposed to just music videos, as well as premium content produced in collaboration with notable YouTube producers and personalities.[44]In December 2015, Google started offering a Google Play Music family plan, that allows unlimited access for up to six family members for US$14.99/month.[45][46][47] The family plan is currently only available in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[48]In April 2016, Google announced that Google Podcasts would be coming to Google Play Music.[49][50][51] Its first original podcast series, \"City Soundtracks\", was announced in March 2017, and \"will feature interviews with various musicians about how their hometowns influenced their work, including the people and the moments that had an impact\".[52][53][54]In November 2016, Google introduced the Google Home smart speaker system, with built-in support for Google Play Music.[55]In June 2018, Google announced that YouTube Red would be replaced by YouTube Premium along with YouTube Music.[56] As a result, users subscribed to Google Play Music in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico are now given access to YouTube Premiumâwhich includes YouTube Music Premium. Users outside of those four countries are still required to pay the regular YouTube Premium price to access Premium features, but are given free access to YouTube Music Premium.[57] Google plans to transition Google Play Music subscribers to the YouTube Music service no earlier than 2019.[13]Standard accounts on Google Play Music are available in 63 countries. The full list includes: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela.[58]Premium subscriptions are available in the same countries as Standard accounts.[58]Availability of music was introduced in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain in October 2012,[59] Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Russia, and Switzerland in September 2013,[60] Mexico in October 2013,[61] Germany in December 2013,[62] Greece, Norway, Sweden, and Slovakia in March 2014,[63] Canada,[64] Poland and Denmark in May 2014,[65] Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and Ukraine in July 2014,[66] Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, El Salvador, and Venezuela in August 2014,[67] Brazil and Uruguay in September 2014,[68] 13 new countries in November 2014,[69] Brazil in November 2014,[70] Argentina in June 2015,[71] Japan in September 2015,[72] South Africa and Serbia in December 2015,[73] and India in September 2016, where only purchasing of music was offered.[74] The All Access subscription service launched in India in April 2017.[75][76]In 2013, Entertainment Weekly compared a number of music services and gave Google Play Music All Access a \"B+\" score, writing, \"The addition of uploading to augment the huge streaming archive fills in some huge gaps.\"[77]"

        "name": "Google Shopping",
        "text": "Google Shopping,[2] formerly Google Product Search, Google Products and Froogle, is a Google service invented by Craig Nevill-Manning which allows users to search for products on online shopping websites and compare prices between different vendors. Google announced at its Marketing Live event in May 2019 that the new Google Shopping will integrate the existing Google Express marketplace into a revamped shopping experience.[3] In the U.S, Google Shopping is accessible from the web and mobile apps, available on Android and iOS. Google Shopping is also available in France, accessible from the web only.[4] Like its predecessor, Google Shopping is free and requires a personal Google account in order to purchase from the platform. A colored price tag icon replaces the parachute icon from Google Express.On the web, shoppers can either go to the Google Search homepage to enter a search query and then select the Shopping tab under the navigation bar, or go directly to the Google Shopping homepage to search for specific items, browse departments, and see trending items and promotional offers. The Google Shopping mobile app opens directly to the shopping homepage, where shoppers can similarly search or browse, and access their shopping lists, order history and notification settings. Currently, the product inventory available on the app is less robust than what is available on the web, since it currently reflects items shoppers can only buy directly on Google. In addition to shopping from well-known online stores, users can shop with confidence at lesser-known online stores when they choose to buy directly on Google, which includes a Google-backed guarantee.[5] The guarantee includes Google customer support, available 7 days a week, and added assistance if the order is late, if something is wrong with the shipment, and to simplify the return and refund process - regardless of the seller. When on the web, shoppers can identify products they can buy on Google by either looking for the colored cart icon within a product image, or by selecting the Buy on Google filter. Free delivery is available on qualifying orders that meet the storeâs minimum order amount.Shoppers can see personalized product recommendations and promotional offers on the Google Shopping homepage depending on their Google account settings. Other features geared to help shoppers find the best prices and places to buy include the ability to track the price of a product, compare the total order cost at online or nearby stores, and access product reviews and related video content.Over the coming year, additional shopping capabilities will be rolled-out and tied into other Google products and platforms in order to simplify a shopperâs buying journey.Originally, the service listed prices submitted by merchants, and was monetized through AdWords advertising like other Google services. However, in May 2012, Google announced that the service (which was also immediately renamed Google Shopping) would shift in late-2012 to a paid model where merchants would have to pay the company in order to list their products on the service.[2][6]In June 2017, Google Shopping was fined a record â¬2.4 billion by the EU Commission for giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results.[7]Created by Craig Nevill-Manning[8] and launched in December 2002, Froogle was different from most other price comparison services in that it used Google's web crawler to index product data from the websites of vendors instead of using paid submissions. As with Google Search, Froogle was instead monetized using Google's AdWords keyword advertising platform.[9][10]With its re-branding as Google Product Search, the service was modified to emphasize integration with Google Search; listings from the service could now appear alongside web search results.[11]Google prominently featured the service result in Google Search starting in January 2008 in Germany and the United Kingdom. It subsequently extended the practice to France in October 2010, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain in May 2011, the Czech Republic in February 2013 and Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden in November 2013.[7]Alongside the announcement of an immediate re-brand to Google Shopping on May 31, 2012, Google also announced that in late 2012, it would change the service to use a \"pay-to-play\" model, where merchants would have to pay Google to list their products on the service, with results influenced by both relevance and the bid amounts they pay. Google justified the move by stating that it would allow the service to \"deliver the best answers for people searching for products and help connect merchants with the right customers.\"[2][12]The change proved controversial; some small businesses showed concern that they would not be able to compete with larger companies that can afford a larger advertising budget.[6] Microsoft's Bing also attacked the move in an advertising campaign known as \"Scroogled,\" which called Google out for using \"deceptive advertising practices\" and suggesting that users use its competing Bing Shopping service instead.[13]Google also revealed plans to integrate Google Catalogs with Google Shopping, to give users \"more ways to find ideas and inspiration as you shop and engage with your favorite brand.\"[14]In June 2017, Google Shopping was fined a record â¬2.4 billion by the EU Commission for giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results.[7]In March 2018, Google introduced Shopping Actions, a commission based model, where customers can shop \"on the Google Assistant and Search with a universal cart, whether they're on mobile, desktop, or even a Google Home device\"[15]Initial case studies on the impact of Shopping Actions vs Google Shopping alone show positive results, with higher Average Order Value, increase in basket size, and higher revenue to merchants.[16]Google Shopping was originally known as Froogle, a pun on the term \"frugal.\" On April 18, 2007, the product was renamed Google Product Search; the original name was dropped due to concerns surrounding internationalization, people not understanding the pun or understanding what the service was actually about, and concerns related to the company's trademark infringement lawsuit against competing website Froogles.[11] On May 31, 2012, the product was renamed to Google Shopping.[2] The URL \"froogle.com\" remains as a redirect to Google Shopping's website.On June 27, 2017, the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, fined Google â¬2.4 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. Google was found to have abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving illegal advantages to another Google product, its own comparison shopping service.[17]According to the European Commission, Google started giving its own Froogle significantly better treatment than rivals as early as 2008. It first began in Germany and the United Kingdom, followed by France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, then the Czech Republic and finally Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden. A total 418 million citizens of the European Economic Area are claimed to have been deprived of the full benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation.[17] Further damage payments may have to be required from Google should it not comply with European antitrust rules within 90 days.[17]Google Shopping is currently available in 121 countries and territories:[18]"

Google store sells products made by Google or made by collaboration with that company. It was introduced on March 11, 2015, and replaced the Devices section of Google Play as Google's hardware retailer. It is overseen by Ana Corrales, who is also the COO of Google's Consumer Hardware division.Google has experimented with physical locations as well. In October 2016, it opened a pop-up shop in New York City to display its then-recently announced hardware products, and the following month it opened \"Google Shops\", store-within-a-store locations at select Best Buy stores in Canada.On the Internet, the Google Store replaced the Devices section on the Google Play website.[1]In October 2016, Google opened Made by Google, a temporary pop-up showroom in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. The space offered a glimpse at hardware products the company had recently developed, including the Pixel smartphone, Google Home smart speaker, and Daydream View virtual reality headset.[2][3][4]In November 2016, Google opened \"Google Shop\", a store-within-a-store where Google displays its hardware products. The Google Shops, available at select Best Buy locations in Canada, gives Google a retail presence that's \"been key to building a premium mobile device customer base thatâs sizable and loyal, and itâs not something Google has really had with its previous Nexus program\". The Shops are \"distinctly Google\", with visual aesthetics featuring \"light wood grain and gray fabric pairing up with playful hints of bright colors\", along with \"custom-created modular furniture that nests when standing room is limited, but can easily accommodate, say, a small group of students with stool seating in a pinch\". In a comment to TechCrunch, Janell Fischer, Google's Director of Retail Marketing, said that \"We love it when people can come in, discover, play and have fun and it just happens to be with technology. So weâve really tried to layer on lots of different immersive sorts of experiences, some that are direct demonstrations of the product and product features, but some that are more exploratory and fun\". Each Google Shop \"could have unique digital content tailored to the city wherein it resides\".[5]Google Store received the 2016 Webby Award in the Consumer Electronics category.[6]"

        "name": "Google Street View",
        "text": "Google Street View is a technology featured in Google Maps and Google Earth that provides interactive panoramas from positions along many streets in the world. It was launched in 2007 in several cities in the United States, and has since expanded to include cities and rural areas worldwide. Streets with Street View imagery available are shown as blue lines on Google Maps.Google Street View displays panoramas of stitched images. Most photography is done by car, but some is done by tricycle, boat, snowmobile, and underwater apparatus, as well as on foot.Street View had its inception in 2001 with the Stanford CityBlock Project, a Google-sponsored Stanford University research project. The project ended in June 2006, and its technology was folded into StreetView.[3]Street View is available as a component of Google Maps, as a web application, and as a mobile application for Android and iOS. Originally, Google Maps used Adobe Flash for Street View.[31] Google overhauled Google Maps in 2013. The newer version uses JavaScript extensively and provides a JavaScript application programming interface.[32] At the time of their release, the new Google Maps and Street View are measured slower than the old version in various setups.[33][34] A user can switch to the old version of Google Maps, which is especially useful when Google Maps is more sluggish than usual.[35][36]The drag-and-drop Pegman icon is the primary user interface element used by Google to connect Maps to Street View. Its name comes from its resemblance to a clothespeg. When not in use, Pegman sits atop the Google Maps zoom controls. Occasionally Pegman \"dresses up\" for special events or is joined by peg friends in Google Maps. When dragged into Street View near Area 51, he becomes a flying saucer. When viewing older views, the Pegman in the minimap changes to Doc Brown from Back to the Future.[37]In June 2012, Google announced that it has captured 20 petabytes of data for Street View, comprising photos taken along 5 million miles of roads, covering 39 countries and about 3,000 cities.[38] Coverage includes much of North and South America, from Cambridge Bay, Nunavut to Half Moon Island in the South Shetland Islands.[39] Maps also include panoramic views taken under water such as in West Nusa Tenggara underwater coral, in the Grand Canyon, inside museums, and Liwa Desert in United Arab Emirates which are viewed from camelback.[40] In a ten-day trek with Apa Sherpa, Google documented Khumbu, Nepal with its Mount Everest, Sherpa communities, monasteries and schools.[41]Google also added landmarks in Egypt, including the Pyramids of Giza, Cairo Citadel, Saqqara, Monastery of Saint Mina, and the Citadel of Qaitbay in the 9 September 2014 release.Many places still have limited or no coverage, including:Google Street View will blur houses for any user who makes a request, in addition to the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates.[51] Privacy advocates have objected to the Google Street View, pointing to views found to show men leaving strip clubs, protesters at an abortion clinic, sunbathers in bikinis, and people engaging in activities visible from public property in which they do not wish to be seen publicly.[52] Another concern is the height of the cameras, and in at least two countries, Japan[53] and Switzerland,[54] Google has had to lower the height of its cameras so as to not peer over fences and hedges. The service also allows users themselves to flag inappropriate or sensitive imagery for Google to review and remove.[55]Police Scotland received an apology for wasting police time in 2014 from a local business owner in Edinburgh who in 2012 had staged a fake murder for the Google camera car by lying in the road \"while his colleague stood over him with a pickaxe handle\".[56] In May 2010, it was revealed that Google had collected and stored payload data from unencrypted Wi-Fi connections as part of Street View.[57][58]The concerns have led to Google not providing or suspending the service in countries around the world.Fine-art photographers have selected images for use in their own work.[66] Although the images may be pixelated, the colours muddy, and the perspective warped, the photographs have been published in book form and exhibited in art galleries, such as the work of Jon Rafman at the Saatchi Gallery, London.[67] In his personal appreciation of Street View material, Rafman sees images which evoke the \"gritty urban life\" depicted in American street photography and the images commissioned by the Farm Security Administration. He also invokes the \"decisive moment\" esthetic of Henri Cartier-Bresson \"as if I were a photojournalist responding instantaneously to an emerging event\".[68]Michael Wolf won an honourable mention in Daily Life in the 2011 World Press Photo competition for some of his work using Google Street View.[69]Mishka Henner was short-listed for the 2013 Deutsche BÃ¶rse Photography Prize in November 2012 for his series 'No Man's Land', which depicts sex workers at rural roadside locations.[70]Swedish programmer Anton WallÃ©n developed a game called GeoGuessr, which places players into a Google Street View and has them guess its location.[71]Canadian artist, Sylvia Grace Borda, worked in conjunction with John M Lynch between 2013-14[72][73] to insert the first staged tableaux[74] into the Google Street View engine.

        "name": "Google Wifi",
        "text": "Google Nest Wifi, formerly Google Wifi is a line of mesh-capable wireless routers developed by Google as part of the Google Nest family of products. The first generation was announced on October 4, 2016, and released in the United States on December 5, 2016. The second generation was announced at the Pixel 4 hardware event on October 15, 2019, and was released in the United States on November 4, 2019.Google Nest Wifi aims to provide enhanced Wi-Fi coverage through the setup of multiple Nest Wifi devices in a home. Nest Wifi automatically switches between access points depending on signal strength. Nest Wifi can be purchased as a single unit or in a multi-pack.Android Police reported in September 2016 that Google was preparing to introduce a mesh-capable wireless router with enhanced range, along with its October 4 date of announcement and US$129 price point.[3][4][5] Google Wifi was officially announced on October 4, 2016, with expected availability in the United States in December.[6][7][8] The device became available in the United States on December 5, 2016,[9] in the United Kingdom on April 6, 2017,[10][11][12] in Canada on April 28, 2017,[13][14] in France and Germany on June 26, 2017,[15][16] in Australia on July 20, 2017,[17] in Hong Kong and Singapore on 30 August, 2017,[18][19][20] and in Philippines on June 26th, 2018.[21]The first generation Google Wifi features 802.11ac connectivity with 2.4GHz and 5GHz channels, 2x2 antennas, and support for beamforming. It has two gigabit Ethernet ports, and contains a quad-core processor with 512 MB RAM and 4 GB flash memory. Wi-Fi access can be controlled through a companion mobile app.The second generation of the product was officially announced at the Pixel 4 hardware event on October 15, 2019, renamed as Google Nest Wifi as part of the company's shift towards its rebranding of all its smart home products to the Google Nest name.In April 2019 some users started reporting that Google Wifi's settings are not accessible. Google responded in the forums that users that have their App Store set to a country that is not in a specific list cannot download their application anymore and change settings of their installed devices. This sparked a wave of consumer criticism of Google effectively blocking users out of their purchased devices. [22]James Trew of Engadget praised the ease of setup for the device, writing that \"Setting up a router isn't usually that hard, but it often involves an ugly web admin panel that -- ironically for a device that helps you enjoy the internet -- looks like it was designed in 2003. You'll set Google WiFi up with an app\" and described the process as \"all very simple and painless\". Trew also liked the design, calling it \"nice\" and compared it to other routers by writing that \"A quick internet search for \"wireless router\" returns a slew of angular black boxes with ugly antennas that might look okay in an office or basement, but nowhere else\" and stated that \"Google WiFi's white cylindrical design, however, is fairly unremarkable, and that's precisely the point\". For performance, Trew was surprised to find that Google Wifi gave him a considerably higher speed than his previous router, describing it as \"almost tripling the transfer rate of my old router every time\". He also praised the app's ability to easily add more units around a house, the ability to manually prioritize what devices should get the highest Internet speed and the mesh network's capabilities of automatically switching between access points. However, he criticized the lack of a website interface and noted that the device might not be suitable for advanced users but rather \"for people who don't enjoy navigating the typical router admin console (or don't even know that their router has one)\".[23]Dong Ngo of CNET also praised the setup process, describing it as \"self-explanatory, and dare I say, fun\". Ngo also praised speed, calling it \"fast\" and that the coverage and reliability provided by the mesh system was \"great\". Similarly to Trew, Ngo criticized the lack of proper customization features, calling it \"frustrating\" and elaborating that \"You can't do as much with the Wifi as you can with a regular router. To name a few, there's no MAC filtering, content filtering, or even support for Dynamic DNS (DDNS)\". Ngo also noted that the Wifi system is connected to a user's Google account \"at all times\", meaning that, while security updates can be provided on a regular basis, the \"constant connection to Google is required. That's a dealbreaker for some\".[24]Dan Seifert of The Verge reiterated praise for design, writing \"each unit is a compact, unobtrusive cylinder that can be tucked away on a shelf or counter and doesnât look like a piece of computer equipment in the middle of your living room\", and also for the setup, describing it as \"painless and took about 10 minutes total to complete\". Seifert wrote that \"In each room, Google Wifi was able to provide a strong wireless signal and enough internet bandwidth for the most demanding streaming needs\" and complimented the system for being able to provide his bedroom with decent speeds, despite it being \"the furthest room\" and the \"hardest test\" in his home. He noted that, while the app shows which access point a device is connected to, it \"doesnât allow you to force devices to hop from one to another\". Overall, Seifert stated that \"If all you care about is raw performance, [Netgear] Orbi is a better router, but for overall experience, including cost and maintenance, Google Wifi is an easier system to use\".[25]"

Hangouts is now part of the G Suite line of products and consists of two primary products: Google Hangouts Meet and Google Hangouts Chat.[7] Google has also begun integrating features of Google Voice, its IP telephony product, into Hangouts, stating that Hangouts is designed to be \"the future\" of Voice. Google will shut down the consumer version of Hangouts in June 2020.[8]Prior to the launch of Hangouts, Google had maintained several similar, but technologically separate messaging services and platforms across its suite of products. These have included the enterprise-oriented Google Talk (based on XMPP), Google+ Messenger, and the Hangouts feature of Google+, which provided chat, voice, videoconferencing features. However, its increasingly fragmented and non-unified suite of messaging offerings was also facing growing competition from services such as Facebook Messenger, iMessage, and WhatsApp. A decision was made to scrap the existing Google Talk system and code a new messaging product through a collaboration with multiple development teams.[9]Following reports that the new service would be known as \"Babel\", the service officially launched as Hangouts during the Google I/O conference on May 15, 2013.[9][10]On February 16, 2015, Google announced it would be discontinuing Google Talk and instructed users to migrate to the Hangouts app on the Chrome browser platform.[11]In January 2016, Google discouraged using Hangouts for SMS, recommending to instead use Google's \"Messenger\" SMS app.[12]In May 2016, at Google I/O 2016, Google announced two new apps: Google Allo, a messaging app with AI capabilities (AI-powered bots[13] and selfie features[14]) and Google Duo, a video calling app. Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones released later that year were the first Google devices shipped with Duo and Allo preinstalled instead of Hangouts.[15] Google has since confirmed that the new apps will not replace Hangouts; Hangouts will remain a separate product.[16][17] In December 2018 Google announced Allo would be discontinued in March 2019 with some of its features migrated into Google Messages.[18]On January 6, 2017, Google announced that the Google Hangouts API would shut down on April 25, 2017.[19]On March 9, 2017, Google announced that Hangouts would be targeted at business users with the Hangouts brand divided into two products: Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. Hangouts Meet would focus on video conferences and Hangouts Chat would be focused on instant messaging with additional features such as bot assistant and threaded messaging.[20] The features would be targeted at business customers while consumer versions would use a freemium model.[21] Google stated in December 2018 that \"classic\" Hangouts will be disabled by October 2019.[22]In November 2018, the desktop Chrome app version of Hangouts started displaying these banner messages at the top of its window: \"The Hangouts Chrome app will be replaced by the Hangouts Chrome extension soon.\" This has generated many negative user reviews on the Chrome Web Store pages for both the Hangouts extension and the app.In August 2019, Google announced that the G-Suite version of Hangouts will be replaced by \"Hangouts Meet\" and \"Hangouts chat\"[23]Hangouts allows conversations between two or more users. The service can be accessed online through the Gmail or Google+ websites, or through mobile apps available for Android and iOS (which were distributed as a successor to their existing Google Talk apps). However, because it uses a proprietary protocol[9] instead of the XMPP open standard protocol used by Google Talk, most third-party applications which had access to Google Talk do not have access to Google+ Hangouts.Chat histories are saved online, allowing them to be synced between devices. A \"watermark\" of a user's avatar is used as a marker to indicate how far they have read into the conversation. Photos can be shared during conversations, which are automatically uploaded into a private Google+ album. Users can also now use color emoji symbols in their messages.[24][25]As with the previous Google+ Hangouts, users can also perform a group video chat with up to 10 users at a time.[26] In 2016 Google upgraded Hangouts to 25 concurrent users in HD video for Work/Education. The new Google Hangouts app on iOS integrates a Google Voice number to some extent, but on Android the SMS support in Hangouts doesn't fully integrate with Google Voice for calls or texts. Integration was first expected by 2014, but was deprecated in January 2016. The reason for the delay appears tied to Google switching away from the XMPP protocol it used, as mentioned above.[27]For Google Chrome, users do not need to install a plugin. However, for Internet Explorer 11, the user must install the \"Google Talk Plugin\" to be able to use the video features.In Android 4.4, Hangouts is integrated with text messages sending and receiving functions, which is the default SMS app on the Nexus 5. For other Android phones, users can choose to open the SMS function when they download the new version of Hangouts via Google Play. SMS conversations are shown in a drawer on the left side. The update also adds GIF support and a new location-sharing button, which allows the user to send their GPS location to their contacts.[28]Hangouts includes the ability to make free voice calls to other Hangouts users,[29] and charges users (via pre-registered credit) to call landline and mobile phones internationally except for calls to the United States and Canada which are free of charge.[30] Currently, Android users must have both the Google Hangouts[29] and Hangouts Dialer[31] apps installed if they wish to call landline or mobile telephone numbers via the public switched telephone network. On August 15, 2016, Google announced that Hangouts on Air will be discontinued on August 1, 2019.

        "name": "Keep",
        "text": "Google Keep is a note-taking service developed by Google. Launched on March 20, 2013, Google Keep is available on the web, and has mobile apps for the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. Keep offers a variety of tools for taking notes, including text, lists, images, and audio. Users can set reminders, which are integrated with Google Now. Text from images can be extracted using optical character recognition, and voice recordings can be transcribed. The interface allows for a single-column view or a multi-column view. Notes can be color-coded, and labels can be applied for organization. Later updates have added functionality to pin notes, and to collaborate on notes with other Keep users in real-time.Google Keep has received mixed reviews. A review just after launch in 2013 praised its speed, the quality of voice notes, synchronization, and the widget that could be placed on the Android home screen. Reviews in 2016 have criticized the lack of formatting options, inability to undo changes, and an interface that only offers two view modes where neither was liked for their handling of long notes. However, Google Keep received praise for features including universal device access, native integration with other Google services, and the option to turn photos into text through optical character recognition.[4]Google Keep allows users to make different kinds of notes, including text, lists, images, and audio.[5] Users can set reminders, which are integrated with Google Now, with options for time or location.[6] Text from images can be extracted using optical character recognition technology.[7][8] Voice recordings created through Keep are automatically transcribed.[9] Keep can convert text notes into checklists.[10] Users can choose between a single-column view and a multi-column view.[5] Notes can be color-coded, with options for white, red, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue or grey.[8][10] Users can press a \"Copy to Google Doc\" button that automatically copies all text into a new Google Docs document.[6] Users can create notes and lists by voice.[6][10] Notes can be categorized using labels, with a list of labels in the app's navigation bar.[10]In November 2014, Google introduced a real-time note cooperation feature between different Keep users, as well as a search feature determined by attributes, such as color, sharing status, or the kind of content in the note.[11] In October 2016, Google added the ability for users to pin notes.[12] In February 2017, Google integrated Google Keep with Google Docs, providing access to notes while using Docs on the web.[13][14] Google Assistant could previously maintain a shopping list within Google Keep. This feature was moved to Google Express in April 2017, resulting in a severe loss of functionality.[15] In July 2017, Google updated Keep on Android with the ability for users to undo and redo changes.[16][17]Google Keep was launched on March 20, 2013 for the Android operating system and on the web.[18][19] The Android app is compatible with Android Wear.[20][21] Users can create new notes using voice input, add and tick off items in lists, and view reminders.[22]An app for the iOS operating system was released on September 24, 2015.[23]In a May 2013 review, Alan Henry of Lifehacker wrote that the interface was \"colorful and easy to use\", and that the colors actually served a purpose in organization and contrast. Henry praised the speed, quality of voice notes, synchronization, and Android home screen widget. He criticized the web interface, as well as the lack of an iOS app.[9]Time listed Google Keep among its 50 best Android applications for 2013.[24]In a January 2016 review, JR Raphael of Computerworld wrote that \"Keep is incredibly close to being an ideal tool for me to collect and manage all of my personal and work-related notes. And, as evidenced by the fact that I continue to use it, its positives outweigh its negatives for me and make it the best all-around option for my needs\", praising what he calls Keep's \"killer features\", namely simplicity, \"easy universal access\", and native integration with other Google services. However, he characterized Keep's lack of formatting options, the inability to undo or revert changes, and a missing search functionality within notes as \"lingering weaknesses\".[25]In a July 2016 review, Jill Duffy of PC Magazine wrote that the interface was best described as \"simplicity\", and criticized it for offering list and grid views that did not make finding information quick or easy. Adding that \"Most of my notes are text-based recipes, which are quite long\", Duffy said the list view was \"even worse\" than the grid view as it only showed \"one note at a time, and it's the most recently edited note.\" She wrote that the web interface was lacking in functionality present in the apps. The mobile app's offering to take a photo and run optical character recognition to have the scan turned into text was described as a \"shining star\", with the comment \"It's an amazing feature, and it works very well\". She also criticized the lack of formatting options, and that sharing options \"is possible but not very refined\".[26]"

It offers satellite imagery, aerial photography, street maps, 360Â° panoramic views of streets (Street View), real-time traffic conditions, and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle and air (in beta), or public transportation.Google Maps began as a C++ desktop program at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005.[1] The service's front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites,[2] and offers a locator for businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map Maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March 2017. However, crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps were not discontinued as the company announced those features will be transferred to the Google Local Guides program.[3]Google Maps' satellite view is a \"top-down\" or \"birds eye\" view; most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 800 to 1,500 feet (240 to 460 m), while most other imagery is from satellites.[4] Much of the available satellite imagery is no more than three years old and is updated on a regular basis.[5] Google Maps used a variant of the Mercator projection, and therefore could not accurately show areas around the poles.[6] However, in August 2018, the desktop version of Google Maps was updated to show a 3D globe as the default projection. It is still possible to switch back to the Mercator Projection in the settings.Google Maps for Android and iOS devices was released in September 2008 and features GPS turn-by-turn navigation along with dedicated parking assistance features. In August 2013, it was determined to be the world's most popular app for smartphones, with over 54% of global smartphone owners using it at least once.[7]In 2012, Google reported having over 7,100 employees and contractors directly working in mapping.[8]In 2017, along with several other services including YouTube, Chrome, Gmail, Search, and Google Play, Google Maps reached over 1 billion users.[9]Google Maps first started as a C++ program designed by two Danish brothers, Lars and Jens Eilstrup Rasmussen, at the Sydney-based company Where 2 Technologies. It was first designed to be separately downloaded by users, but the company later pitched the idea for a purely Web-based product to Google management, changing the method of distribution.[10] In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google Inc.[11] where it transformed into the web application Google Maps. In the same month, Google acquired Keyhole, a geospatial data visualization company (with controversial investment from the CIA), whose marquee application suite, Earth Viewer, emerged as the highly successful Google Earth application in 2005 while other aspects of its core technology were integrated into Google Maps.[12] In September 2004, Google acquired ZipDash, a company that provided realtime traffic analysis.[13]The launch of Google Maps was first announced on the Google Blog on February 8, 2005.[14]In September 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Google Maps quickly updated its satellite imagery of New Orleans to allow users to view the extent of the flooding in various parts of that city.[15][16]On November 28, 2007, Google Maps for Mobile 2.0 was released.[17][18][19] It featured a beta version of a \"My Location\" feature, which uses the GPS / Assisted GPS location of the mobile device, if available, supplemented by determining the nearest wireless networks and cell sites.[18][19] The software looks up the location of the cell site using a database of known wireless networks and sites.[20][21] By triangulating the different signal strengths from cell transmitters and then using their location property (retrieved from the database), My Location determines the user's current location.[22]On September 23, 2008, coinciding with the announcement of the first commercial Android device, Google announced that a Google Maps app had been released for its Android operating system.[23][24]In October 2009, Google replaced Tele Atlas as their primary supplier of geospatial data in the US version of Maps and used their own data.[25]On April 19, 2011, Map Maker was added to the American version of Google Maps, allowing any viewer to edit and add changes to Google Maps. This provides Google with local map updates almost in real time instead of waiting for digital map data companies to release more infrequent updates.On January 31, 2012, Google, due to offering its Maps for free, was found guilty of abusing the dominant position of its Google Maps application and ordered by a court to pay a fine and damages to Bottin Cartographer, a French mapping company.[26] This ruling was overturned on appeal.[27]In June 2012, Google started mapping Britain's rivers and canals in partnership with the Canal and River Trust. The company has stated that it would update the program during the year to allow users to plan trips which include locks, bridges and towpaths along the 2,000 miles of river paths in the UK.[28]In December 2012, the Google Maps application was separately made available in the App Store, after Apple removed it from its default installation of the mobile operating system version iOS 6 in September 2012.[29]On January 29, 2013, Google Maps was updated to include a map of North Korea.[30] As of May 3, 2013, Google Maps recognizes Palestine as a country, instead of redirecting to the Palestinian territories.[31]In August 2013, Google Maps removed the Wikipedia Layer, which provided links to Wikipedia content about locations shown in Google Maps using Wikipedia geocodes.[32]On April 12, 2014, Google Maps was updated to reflect the 2014 Crimean crisis. Crimea is shown as the Republic of Crimea in Russia and as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in Ukraine. All other versions show a dotted disputed border.[33]In April 2015, on a map near the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi, imagery of the Android logo urinating on the Apple logo was added via Map Maker and appeared on Google Maps. The vandalism was soon removed and Google publicly apologized.[34] However, as a result, Google disabled user moderation on Map Maker, and on May 12, disabled editing worldwide until it could devise a new policy for approving edits and avoiding vandalism.[35]On April 29, 2015, users of the classic Google Maps were forwarded to the new Google Maps with the option to be removed from the interface.[36]On July 14, 2015, the Chinese name for Scarborough Shoal was removed after a petition from the Philippines was posted on Change.org.[37]On June 27, 2016, Google rolled out new satellite imagery worldwide sourced from Landsat 8, comprising over 700 trillion pixels of new data.[38] In September 2016, Google Maps acquired mapping analytics startup Urban Engines.[39]In 2016, the Government of South Korea offered Google conditional access to the country's geographic database â access that already allows indigenous Korean mapping providers high-detail maps. Google declined the offer, as it was unwilling to accept restrictions on reducing the quality around locations the South Korean Government felt were sensitive.[40]On October 16, 2017, Google Maps was updated with accessible imagery of several planets and moons such as Titan, Mercury, and Venus, as well as direct access to imagery of the Moon and Mars.[41][42]In May 2018, Google announced major changes to the API structure starting June 11, 2018. This change consolidated the 18 different endpoints into three services and merged the basic and premium plans into one pay-as-you-go plan.[43] In June, Google postponed the change date to July 16, 2018.In August 2018, Google Maps designed its overall view (when zoomed out completely) into a 3D globe dropping the Mercator projection, which was used to project the planet onto a flat surface.[44] In January 2019, Google Maps added speed trap and speed camera alerts as reported by other users.[45][46]Google Maps provides a route planner,[47] allowing users to find available directions through driving, public transportation, walking, or biking.[48] Google has partnered globally with over 800 public transportation providers to adopt General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), making the data available to third parties.[49][50] The app will also have starred lines now to indicate users' transit route in the latest update in October 2019. Along with this the incognito mode, eyes free walking navigation features have been released earlier[51].In 2007, Google began offering traffic data as a colored overlay on top of roads and motorways to represent the speed of traffic. Crowdsourcing is used to obtain the GPS-determined locations of a large number of cellphone users, from which live traffic maps are produced.[52][53][54]Google has stated that the speed and location information it collects to calculate traffic conditions is anonymous.[55] Options available in each phone's settings allow users not to share information about their location with Google Maps.[56] Google stated, \"Once you disable or opt out of My Location, Maps will not continue to send radio information back to Google servers to determine your handset's approximate location\".[57][failed verification]On May 25, 2007, Google released Google Street View, a new feature of Google Maps which provides 360Â° panoramic street-level views of various locations. On the date of release, the feature only included five cities in the US. It has since expanded to thousands of locations around the world. In July 2009, Google began mapping college campuses and surrounding paths and trails.Street View garnered much controversy after its release because of privacy concerns about the uncensored nature of the panoramic photographs, although the views are only taken on public streets.[58][59] Since then, Google has begun blurring faces and license plates through automated facial recognition.[60][61][62]In late 2014, Google launched Google Underwater Street View, including 2,300 kilometres (1,400 mi) of the Australian Great Barrier Reef in 3D. The images are taken by special cameras which turn 360 degrees and take shots every 3 seconds.[63]In 2017, in both Google Maps and Google Earth, Street View navigation of the International Space Station interior spaces became available.In December 2009, Google introduced a new view consisting of 45Â° angle aerial imagery, offering a \"bird's eye view\" of cities. The first cities available were San Jose and San Diego. This feature was initially available only to developers via the Google Maps API.[64] In February 2010, it was introduced as an experimental feature in Google Maps Labs.[65] In July 2010, 45Â° imagery was made available in Google Maps in select cities in the United States and worldwide.[66]Google collates business listings from multiple on-line and off-line sources. To reduce duplication in the index, Google's algorithm combines listings automatically based on address, phone number, or geocode,[67] but sometimes information for separate businesses will be inadvertently merged with each other, resulting in listings inaccurately incorporating elements from multiple businesses.[68] Google allows business owners to verify their own business data through Google My Business,[69] and has also recruited volunteers to check and correct ground truth data.[70]Google Maps can easily be manipulated by businesses which aren't physically located in the area they record a listing. There are cases of people abusing Google Maps to overtake their competition where they place a number of unverified listings on online directory sites knowing the information will roll across to Google (duplicate sites). The people that update these listings do not use a registered business name. Keywords and location details are placed on their Google Maps business title which overtake credible business listings. In Australia in particular, genuine companies and businesses are noticing a trend of fake business listings in a variety of industries.[71]In March 2011, indoor maps were added to Google Maps, giving users the ability to navigate themselves within buildings such as airports, museums, shopping malls, big-box stores, universities, transit stations, and other public spaces (including underground facilities). Google encourages owners of public facilities to submit floor plans of their buildings in order to add them to the service.[72] Map users can view different floors of a building or subway station by clicking on a level selector that is displayed near any structures which are mapped on multiple levels.My Maps is a feature in Google Maps launched in April 2007 that enables users to create custom maps for personal use or sharing. Users can add points, lines, shapes, notes and images on top of Google Maps using a WYSIWYG editor.[73] An Android app for My Maps, initially released in March 2013 under the name Google Maps Engine Lite, is also available.[74][75]Google Local Guides is a program launched by Google Maps to enable its users to contribute to Google Maps and provide them additional perks and benefits for the work. The program is partially a successor to Google Map Maker as features from the former program became integrated into the website and app.[76]The program consists of adding reviews, photos, basic information, videos and correcting information such as wheelchair accessibility.[77][78]The maps app will also have a theme for navigation mode for users in line with current trends.[79]As the user drags the map, the grid squares are downloaded from the server and inserted into the page. When a user searches for a business, the results are downloaded in the background for insertion into the side panel and map; the page is not reloaded. A hidden iframe with form submission is used because it preserves browser history. Like many other Google web applications, Google Maps uses JavaScript extensively.[80] The site also uses JSON for data transfer rather than XML, for performance reasons.The version of Google Street View for classic Google Maps required Adobe Flash.[81] In October 2011, Google announced MapsGL, a WebGL version of Maps with better renderings and smoother transitions.[82] Indoor maps uses JPG, .PNG, .PDF, .BMP, or .GIF, for floor plans.[83]Users who are logged into a Google Account can save locations so that they are overlaid on the map with various colored \"pins\" whenever they browse the application. These \"Saved places\" can be organised into user named lists and shared with other users. One default list \"Starred places\" also automatically creates a record in another Google product, Google Bookmarks.The Google Maps terms and conditions[84] state that usage of material from Google Maps is regulated by Google Terms of Service[85] and some additional restrictions. Google has either purchased local map data from established companies, or has entered into lease agreements to use copyrighted map data.[86] The owner of the copyright is listed at the bottom of zoomed maps. For example, street maps in Japan are leased from Zenrin. Street maps in China are leased from AutoNavi.[87] Russian street maps are leased from Geocentre Consulting and Tele Atlas. Data for North Korea is sourced from the companion project Google Map Maker.Street map overlays, in some areas, may not match up precisely with the corresponding satellite images. The street data may be entirely erroneous, or simply out of date: \"The biggest challenge is the currency of data, the authenticity of data,\" said Google Earth representative Brian McClendon. As a result, in March 2008 Google added a feature to edit the locations of houses and businesses.[88][89]Restrictions have been placed on Google Maps through the apparent censoring of locations deemed potential security threats. In some cases the area of redaction is for specific buildings, but in other cases, such as Washington, D.C.,[90] the restriction is to use outdated imagery.After the success of reverse-engineered mashups such as chicagocrime.org and housingmaps.com, Google launched the Google Maps API in June 2005[91] to allow developers to integrate Google Maps into their websites. It was a free service that didn't require an API key until June 2018 (changes went into effect on July 16), when it was announced that an API key linked to a Google Cloud account with billing enabled would be required to access the API.[92] The API currently does not contain ads, but Google states in their terms of use that they reserve the right to display ads in the future.[93]By using the Google Maps API, it is possible to embed Google Maps into an external website, on to which site-specific data can be overlaid.[94] Although initially only a JavaScript API, the Maps API was expanded to include an API for Adobe Flash applications (but this has been deprecated), a service for retrieving static map images, and web services for performing geocoding, generating driving directions, and obtaining elevation profiles. Over 1,000,000[95] web sites use the Google Maps API, making it the most heavily used web application development API.[96] In September 2011, Google announced it would deprecate the Google Maps API for Flash.[97]The Google Maps API is free for commercial use, provided that the site on which it is being used is publicly accessible and does not charge for access, and is not generating more than 25,000 map accesses a day.[98][99] Sites that do not meet these requirements can purchase the Google Maps API for Business.[100]As of 21 June 2018, Google increased the prices of the Maps API and requires a billing profile.[101]Due to restrictions on geographic data in China, Google Maps must partner with a Chinese digital map provider in order to legally show Chinese map data. Since 2006, this partner has been AutoNavi.[87]Within China, the State Council mandates that all maps of China use the GCJ-02 coordinate system, which is offset from the WGS-84 system used in most of the world. google.cn/maps (formerly Google Ditu) uses the GCJ-02 system for both its street maps[102] and satellite imagery.[103] google.com/maps also uses GCJ-02 data for the street map, but uses WGS-84 coordinates for satellite imagery,[104] causing the so-called China GPS shift problem.Frontier alignments also present some differences between google.cn/maps and google.com/maps. On the latter, sections of the Chinese border with India and Pakistan are shown with dotted lines, indicating areas or frontiers in dispute. However, google.cn shows the Chinese frontier strictly according to Chinese claims with no dotted lines indicating the border with India and Pakistan. For example, the South Tibet region claimed by China but administered by India as a large part of Arunachal Pradesh is shown inside the Chinese frontier by google.cn, with Indian highways ending abruptly at the Chinese claim line. Google.cn also shows Taiwan and the South China Sea Islands as part of China. Google Ditu's street map coverage of Taiwan no longer omits major state organs, such as the Presidential Palace, the five Yuans, and the Supreme Court.[105]Feature-wise, google.cn/maps does not feature My Maps. On the other hand, while google.cn displays virtually all text in Chinese, google.com/maps displays most text (user-selectable real text as well as those on map) in English. This behavior of displaying English text is not consistent but intermittent â sometimes it is in English, sometimes it is in Chinese. The criteria for choosing which language is displayed are not known publicly.Google Latitude was a feature from Google that lets users share their physical locations with other people. This service was based on Google Maps, specifically on mobile devices. There was an iGoogle widget for desktops and laptops as well.[106] Some concerns were expressed about the privacy issues raised by the use of the service. On August 9, 2013, this service was discontinued,[107] and in March 22, 2017, Google incorporated the features from Latitude into the Google Maps app.[108]In areas where Google Map Maker was available, for example, much of Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe as well as the United States and Canada, anyone who logged into their Google account could directly improve the map by fixing incorrect driving directions, adding biking trails, or adding a missing building or road. General map errors in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United States could be reported using the Report a Problem link in Google Maps and would be updated by Google.[109] For areas where Google used Tele Atlas data, map errors could be reported using Tele Atlas map insight.[110]If imagery was missing, outdated, misaligned, or generally incorrect, one could notify Google through their contact request form.[111]In November 2016, Google announced the discontinuation of Google Map Maker as of March 2017.[112]Google Maps is available as a mobile app for the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. The Android app was first released in September 2008,[117][118] though the GPS-localization feature had been in testing on cellphones since 2007.[119][120][121] Up until iOS 6, the built-in maps application on the iOS operating system was powered by Google Maps. However, with the announcement of iOS 6 in June 2012, Apple announced that they had created their own Apple Maps mapping service,[122] which officially replaced Google Maps when iOS 6 was released on September 19, 2012.[123] However, at launch, Apple Maps received significant criticism from users due to inaccuracies, errors and bugs.[124][125] One day later, The Guardian reported that Google was preparing its own Google Maps app,[126] which was released on December 12, 2012.[127][128] Within only two days, the application had been downloaded over ten million times.[129]The Google Maps apps for iOS and Android have many of the same features, including turn-by-turn navigation, street view, and public transit information.[130][131] Turn-by-turn navigation was originally announced by Google as a separate beta testing app exclusive to Android 2.0 devices in October 2009.[132][133] The original standalone iOS version did not support the iPad,[131] but tablet support was added with version 2.0 in July 2013.[134] An update in June 2012 for Android devices added support for offline access to downloaded maps of certain regions,[135][136] a feature that was eventually released for iOS devices, and made more robust on Android, in May 2014.[137][138]At the end of 2015 Google Maps announced its new offline functionality,[139] but with various limitations â downloaded area cannot exceed 120,000 square kilometres[140][141] and require considerable amount of storage space.[142] In January 2017, Google added a feature exclusively to Android that will, in some U.S. cities, indicate the level of difficulty in finding available parking spots,[143] and on both Android and iOS, the app can, as of an April 2017 update, remember where users parked.[144][145] In August 2017, Google Maps for Android was updated with new functionality to actively help the user in finding parking lots and garages close to a destination.[146] In December 2017, Google added a new two-wheeler mode to its Android app, designed for users in India, allowing for more accessibility in traffic conditions.[147][148]USA Today welcomed the application back to iOS, saying: \"The reemergence in the middle of the night of a Google Maps app for the iPhone is like the return of an old friend. Only your friend, who'd gone missing for three months, comes back looking better than ever.\"[149] Jason Parker of CNET, calling it \"the king of maps\", said, \"With its iOS Maps app, Google sets the standard for what mobile navigation should be and more.\"[150] Bree Fowler of the Associated Press compared Google's and Apple's map applications, saying: \"The one clear advantage that Apple has is style. Like Apple devices, the maps are clean and clear and have a fun, pretty element to them, especially in 3-D. But when it comes down to depth and information, Google still reigns superior and will no doubt be welcomed back by its fans.\"[151] Gizmodo gave it a ranking of 4.5 stars, stating: \"Maps Done Right\".[152] According to The New York Times, Google \"admits that itâs [iOS app is] even better than Google Maps for Android phones, which has accommodated its evolving feature set mainly by piling on menus\".[153]However, Google Maps' location tracking is widely regarded as a threat to users' privacy, with Dylan Tweney of VentureBeat writing in August 2014 that \"Google is probably logging your location, step by step, via Google Maps\", and linked users to Google's location history map, which \"lets you see the path youâve traced for any given day that your smartphone has been running Google Maps\". Tweney then provided instructions on how disable location history.[154] The history tracking was also noticed, and recommended disabled, by editors at CNET[155] and TechCrunch.[156] Additionally, Quartz reported in April 2014 that a \"sneaky new privacy change\" would have an effect on the majority of iOS users. The privacy change, an update to the Gmail iOS app that \"now supports sign-in across Google iOS apps, including Maps, Drive, YouTube and Chrome\", meant that Google would be able to identify users' actions across its different apps.[157]The Android version of the app surpassed 5 billion installations in March 2019.[158]Google Maps Go, a version of the app designed for lower-end devices was released in beta in January 2018.[159] By September 2018, the app had over 10 million installations.[160]In 2005 the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) complained about the potential for terrorists to use the satellite images in planning attacks, with specific reference to the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor; however, the Australian Federal government did not support the organization's concern. At the time of the ANSTO complaint, Google had colored over some areas for security (mostly in the US), such as the rooftop of the White House and several other Washington, D.C., US buildings.[161][162][163]In October 2010, Nicaraguan military commander EdÃ©n Pastora stationed Nicaraguan troops on the Isla Calero (in the delta of the San Juan River), justifying his action on the border delineation given by Google Maps. Google has since updated its data which it found to be incorrect.[164]On January 27, 2014, documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA and the GCHQ intercepted Google Maps queries made on smartphones, and used them to locate the users making these queries. One leaked document, dating to 2008, stated that \"[i]t effectively means that anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system.\"[165]"

        "text": "A message is a discrete unit of communication intended by the source for consumption by some recipient or group of recipients. A message may be delivered by various means, including courier, telegraphy, carrier pigeon and electronic bus. A message can be the content of a broadcast. An interactive exchange of messages forms a conversation.One example of a message is a communiquÃ© (/kÉËmjuËnÉªkeÉª/), which is a brief report or statement released by a public agency.In communication between humans, messages can be verbal or nonverbal:There are two main senses of the word \"message\" in computing: messages between the human users of computer systems that are delivered by those computer systems, and messages passed between programs or between components of a single program, for their own purposes.Because computers are automated, and they do not require human interaction to do something, there have been many safety and privacy concerns in many areas of the computer science industry regarding messages. There have been many cases where instant messaging apps were found to be at risk for spyware.[3] These concerns are not just limited to cellphones, laptops, desktops, or devices of the like. Some of these concerns even point towards displays in car dashboards, where these device are as smart as smartphones, however can be prone to attacks and is known that auto manufacturers have little to no regulations to follow when putting these devices in car dashboards.[4] It also has been found by research that car information displays on dashboards can be distracting.[5]"

        "name": "News",
        "text": "Google News is a news aggregator app developed by Google. It presents a continuous, customizable flow of articles organized from thousands of publishers and magazines. Google News is available as an app on Android, iOS, and the Web.Google released a beta version in September 2002 and the official app in January 2006.[1] The initial idea was developed by Krishna Bharat.[2][3]As of 2013, Google News was watching more than 50,000[4] news sources worldwide. Versions for more than 60 regions in 28 languages were available in March 2012. As of September 2015, service is offered in the following 35 languages: Arabic, Bengali, Bulgarian, Cantonese, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Indonesian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.[5]The service covers news articles appearing within the past 30 days on various news websites. In total, Google News aggregates content from more than 20,000 publishers.[6] For the English language, it covers about 4,500 sites;[7] for other languages, fewer. Its front page provides roughly the first 200 characters of the article and a link to its larger content. Websites may or may not require a subscription; sites requiring subscription are noted in the article description.[8]On December 1, 2009, Google announced changes to their \"first click free\" program,[9][clarification needed] which has been running since 2008 and allows users to find and read articles behind a paywall. The reader's first click to the content is free, and the number after that would be set by the content provider.[10]The layout of Google News underwent a major revision on May 16, 2011.On July 14, 2011, Google introduced \"Google News Badges\",[11] which it later retired in October 2012.[12]Additionally in July 2011, the Sci/Tech section of the English Google News versions was split up into two sections: Science and Technology. It was announced that this section split would be performed on other language versions as well.[13] As of early 2013, this split had not been applied to all language versions of Google News.[citation needed]In June 2017, the desktop version of Google News saw a thorough redesign that according to Google had the goal to \"make news more accessible and easier to navigate ... with a renewed focus on facts, diverse perspectives, and more control for users.\"[14] Yet several options such as the search tools menu were removed along with the redesign, making searches much more difficult. It now uses a card format for grouping related news stories, and as summarized by Engadget, \"doesn't look like a search results page anymore\", removing text snippets and blue links.[15]In March 2005, Agence France-Presse (AFP) sued Google for $17.5 million, alleging that Google News infringed on its copyright because \"Google includes AFP's photos, stories and news headlines on Google News without permission from Agence France Presse\".[16][17] It was also alleged that Google ignored a cease and desist order, though Google counters that it has opt-out procedures which AFP could have followed but did not. Google now hosts Agence France-Presse news, as well as the Associated Press, Press Association and the Canadian Press. This arrangement started in August 2007.[18] In 2007, Google announced it was paying for Associated Press content displayed in Google News, however the articles are not permanently archived.[19][20] That arrangement ceased on December 23, 2009 when Google News ceased carrying Associated Press content.[21]In 2007, a preliminary injunction and then a Belgian court ruled that Google did not have the right to display the lead paragraph from French-language Belgian news sources when Google aggregated news stories,[22] nor to provide free access to cached copies of the full content (\"in cache\" feature),[23] due to both copyright and the sui generis database rights.[24] Google responded by removing the publications both from Google News and the main Google web search.[25] According to the 2009 Report on the outlook for copyright in the EU,With the Google-Copiepresse judgment of 13 February 2007, on the other hand, the Belgian judge ruled that a copy of a webpage memorised by the Google server and the existence of a link giving public access to the same webpage contravene the rights of reproduction and communication to the public. [...] the Belgian judge took the view that Googleâs reproduction without comment of parts of articles was not covered by this exception. The same judgement does not consider the exception in respect of quotations for purposes such as criticism or review provided for in Article 5.3.d to be applicable to the Google News service.In May 2011 the ruling was upheld in appeal[27] after Google reiterated most legal defences from the first grade plus some new ones, which the Court rejected based on the Infopaq ruling and others. In July 2011, Copiepress publications were restored on Google News after they requested so and renounced any complaint based on the judgement.[28]Nevertheless, in a 2017 briefing on the ancillary copyright for press publishers paid by the European Commission, prof. HÃ¶ppner thought the sui generis database right was not violated by most platforms on the basis that the \"substantial part\" criterion may be too high a bar after C-444/02 Fixtures Marketing v. OPAP[29] and that no publisher was known to have won a case with it.[30]Some Europe-based news outlets have asked their governments to consider making Google pay to host links. In Germany, their lobbying lead the introduction of the ancillary copyright for press publishers in 2013. In October 2014, a group of German publishers granted Google a license to use snippets of their publications gratis; the group had first claimed that such snippets were illegal, and then complained when they were removed by Google.[31] In December 2014, Google announced it would be shutting down the Google News service in Spain.[32] A new law in Spain, lobbied for by the Spanish newspaper publishers' association AEDE, would require that news aggregators would have to pay news services for the right to use snippets of their stories on Google News.[33] Rather than add advertisements to the news site, Google chose to shut down their service, and remove all links to Spain-based news sites from international versions of the site.[34]The attempt at establishing a publisher right on press publications was then repeated at EU level with the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market.Newspapers representing more than 90 percent of the market in Brazil opted out of having their links appear in Google News according to reports, resulting in only a \"negligible\" drop in traffic.[25]Users can request e-mail \"alerts\" on various keyword topics by subscribing to Google News Alerts. E-mails are sent to subscribers whenever news articles matching their requests come online. Alerts are also available via RSS and Atom feeds.Users used to be able to customize the displayed sections, their location on the page, and how many stories are visible with a JavaScript-based drag and drop interface. However, for the US site, this has been disabled in favor of a new layout; roll-out of this layout is planned for other locales in the near future. Stories from different editions of Google News can be combined to form one personalized page, with the options stored in a cookie. The service has been integrated with Google Search History since November 2005. Upon its graduation from beta, a section was added that displays recommended news based on the user's Google News search history and the articles the user has clicked on (if the user has signed up for Search History).A revamped version of Google News was introduced in May 2018 that included artificial intelligence features to help users find relevant information.[35]On June 6, 2006, Google News expanded, adding a News Archive Search feature, offering users historical archives going back more than 200 years from some of its sources. There was a timeline view available, to select news from various years.An expansion of the service was announced on September 8, 2008, when Google News began to offer indexed content from scanned newspapers.[36] The depth of chronological coverage varies; beginning in 2008, the entire content of the New York Times back to its founding in 1851 has been available.In early 2010, Google removed direct access to the archive search from the main Google News page, advanced news search page and default search results pages. These pages indicated that the search covered \"Any time\", but did not include the archive and only included recent news.During the summer of 2010, Google decided to redesign the format of the Google news page, creating a firestorm of complaints.[37]In May 2011, Google cancelled plans to scan further old newspapers. About 60 million newspaper pages had been scanned prior to this event.[38] Google announced that it would instead focus on \"Google One Pass, a platform that enables publishers to sell content and subscriptions directly from their own sites\".[39]In August 2011, the \"News Archive Advanced Search\" functionality was removed entirely, again generating complaints from regular users who found that the changes rendered the service unusable.[40] Archival newspaper articles could still be accessed via the Google News Search page, but key functionalities such as the timeline view and ability to specify more than 10 results per page were removed.On September 7, 2008, United Airlines, which was the subject of an indexed, archived article, lost and later not quite regained US$1 billion in market value when a 2002 Chicago Tribune article about the bankruptcy filing of the airline in that year appeared in the current \"most viewed\" category on the website of the Sun-Sentinel, a sister paper.[41] Google News index's next pass found the link as new news, and Income Security Advisors found the Google result to be new news, which was passed along to Bloomberg News, where it was briefly a current headline and very widely viewed.[41]"

        "name": "Scholar",
        "text": "Google Scholar is a freely accessible web search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines. Released in beta in November 2004, the Google Scholar index includes most peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports, and other scholarly literature, including court opinions and patents.[1] While Google does not publish the size of Google Scholar's database, scientometric researchers estimated it to contain roughly 389 million documents including articles, citations and patents making it the world's largest academic search engine in January 2018.[2] Previously, the size was estimated at 160 million documents as of May 2014.[3] An earlier statistical estimate published in PLOS ONE using a Mark and recapture method estimated approximately 80â90% coverage of all articles published in English with an estimate of 100 million.[4] This estimate also determined how many documents were freely available on the web.Google Scholar has been criticized for not vetting journals and for including predatory journals in its index.[5]Google Scholar arose out of a discussion between Alex Verstak and Anurag Acharya,[6] both of whom were then working on building Google's main web index.[7][8] Their goal was to \"make the world's problem solvers 10% more efficient\"[9] by allowing easier and more accurate access to scientific knowledge. This goal is reflected in the Google Scholar's advertising slogan â \"Stand on the shoulders of giants\" â taken from a quote by holy Bernard of Chartres and is a nod to the scholars who have contributed to their fields over the centuries, providing the foundation for new intellectual achievements.Scholar has gained a range of features over time. In 2006, a citation importing feature was implemented supporting bibliography managers (such as RefWorks, RefMan, EndNote, and BibTeX). In 2007, Acharya announced that Google Scholar had started a program to digitize and host journal articles in agreement with their publishers, an effort separate from Google Books, whose scans of older journals do not include the metadata required for identifying specific articles in specific issues.[10] In 2011, Google removed Scholar from the toolbars on its search pages,[11] making it both less easily accessible and less discoverable for users not already aware of its existence. Around this period, sites with similar features such as CiteSeer, Scirus, and Microsoft Windows Live Academic search were developed. Some of these are now defunct; although in 2016, Microsoft launched a new competitor, Microsoft Academic.A major enhancement was rolled out in 2012, with the possibility for individual scholars to create personal \"Scholar Citations profiles\", public author profiles that are editable by authors themselves.[12] Individuals, logging on through a Google account with a bona fide address usually linked to an academic institution, can now create their own page giving their fields of interest and citations. Google Scholar automatically calculates and displays the individual's total citation count, h-index, and i10-index. According to Google, \"three quarters of Scholar search results pages [...] show links to the authors' public profiles\" as of August 2014.[12]A feature introduced in November 2013 allows logged-in users to save search results into the \"Google Scholar library\", a personal collection which the user can search separately and organize by tags.[13] A metrics feature now supports viewing the impact of academic journals,[14] and whole fields of science, via the \"metrics\" button. This reveals the top journals in a field of interest, and the articles generating these journal's impact can also be accessed.Google Scholar allows users to search for digital or physical copies of articles, whether online or in libraries.[15] It indexes \"full-text journal articles, technical reports, preprints, theses, books, and other documents, including selected Web pages that are deemed to be 'scholarly.'\"[16] Because many of Google Scholar's search results link to commercial journal articles, most people will be able to access only an abstract and the citation details of an article, and have to pay a fee to access the entire article.[16] The most relevant results for the searched keywords will be listed first, in order of the author's ranking, the number of references that are linked to it and their relevance to other scholarly literature, and the ranking of the publication that the journal appears in.[17]Using its \"group of\" feature, it shows the available links to journal articles. In the 2005 version, this feature provided a link to both subscription-access versions of an article and to free full-text versions of articles; for most of 2006, it provided links to only the publishers' versions. Since December 2006, it has provided links to both published versions and major open access repositories, but still does not cover those posted on individual faculty web pages;[citation needed] access to such self-archived non-subscription versions is now provided by a link to Google, where one can find such open access articles.Through its \"cited by\" feature, Google Scholar provides access to abstracts of articles that have cited the article being viewed.[18] It is this feature in particular that provides the citation indexing previously only found in CiteSeer, Scopus, and Web of Science. Through its \"Related articles\" feature, Google Scholar presents a list of closely related articles, ranked primarily by how similar these articles are to the original result, but also taking into account the relevance of each paper.[19]Google Scholar's legal database of US cases is extensive. Users can search and read published opinions of US state appellate and supreme court cases since 1950, US federal district, appellate, tax, and bankruptcy courts since 1923 and US Supreme Court cases since 1791.[18] Google Scholar embeds clickable citation links within the case and the How Cited tab allows lawyers to research prior case law and the subsequent citations to the court decision.[20] The Google Scholar Legal Content Star Paginator extension inserts Westlaw and LexisNexis style page numbers in line with the text of the case.[21]While most academic databases and search engines allow users to select one factor (e.g. relevance, citation counts, or publication date) to rank results, Google Scholar ranks results with a combined ranking algorithm in a \"way researchers do, weighing the full text of each article, the author, the publication in which the article appears, and how often the piece has been cited in other scholarly literature\".[17] Research has shown that Google Scholar puts high weight especially on citation counts[22] and words included in a document's title.[23] As a consequence, the first search results are often highly cited articles.Some searchers found Google Scholar to be of comparable quality and utility to subscription-based databases when looking at citations of articles in some specific journals.[24][25] The reviews recognize that its \"cited by\" feature in particular poses serious competition to Scopus and Web of Science. A study looking at the biomedical field found citation information in Google Scholar to be \"sometimes inadequate, and less often updated\".[26] The coverage of Google Scholar may vary by discipline compared to other general databases.[27] Google Scholar strives to include as many journals as possible, including predatory journals, which \"have polluted the global scientific record with pseudo-science, a record that Google Scholar dutifully and perhaps blindly includes in its central index.\"[28] Google Scholar does not publish a list of journals crawled or publishers included, and the frequency of its updates is uncertain. Bibliometric evidence suggests Google Scholar's coverage of the sciences and social sciences is competitive with other academic databases; however as of 2017, Scholar's coverage of the arts and humanities has not been investigated empirically and Scholar's utility for disciplines in these fields remains ambiguous.[29] Especially early on, some publishers did not allow Scholar to crawl their journals. Elsevier journals have been included since mid-2007, when Elsevier began to make most of its ScienceDirect content available to Google Scholar and Google's web search.[30] As of February 2008, the absentees still included the most recent years of the American Chemical Society journals. It is, therefore, impossible to know how current or exhaustive searches are in Google Scholar, although a recent study[4] estimates that Google Scholar can find almost 90% (approximately 100 million) of all scholarly documents on the Web written in English. Large-scale longitudinal studies have found between 40â60% of scientific articles are available in full text via Google Scholar links.[31]Google Scholar puts high weight on citation counts in its ranking algorithm and therefore is being criticized for strengthening the Matthew effect;[22] as highly cited papers appear in top positions they gain more citations while new papers hardly appear in top positions and therefore get less attention by the users of Google Scholar and hence fewer citations. Google Scholar effect is a phenomenon when some researchers pick and cite works appearing in the top results on Google Scholar regardless of their contribution to the citing publication because they automatically assume these worksâ credibility and believe that editors, reviewers, and readers expect to see these citations.[32] Google Scholar has problems identifying publications on the arXiv preprint server correctly. Interpunctuation characters in titles produce wrong search results, and authors are assigned to wrong papers, which leads to erroneous additional search results. Some search results are even given without any comprehensible reason.[33][34] Google Scholar is vulnerable to spam.[35][36] Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg demonstrated that citation counts on Google Scholar can be manipulated and complete non-sense articles created with SCIgen were indexed from Google Scholar.[37] They concluded that citation counts from Google Scholar should only be used with care especially when used to calculate performance metrics such as the h-index or impact factor. Google Scholar started computing an h-index in 2012 with the advent of individual Scholar pages. Several downstream packages like Harzing's Publish or Perish also use its data.[38] The practicality of manipulating h-index calculators by spoofing Google Scholar was demonstrated in 2010 by Cyril Labbe from Joseph Fourier University, who managed to rank \"Ike Antkare\" ahead of Albert Einstein by means of a large set of SCIgen-produced documents citing each other (effectively an academic link farm).[39] As of 2010, Google Scholar was not able to shepardize case law, as Lexis can.[40] Unlike other indexes of academic work such as Scopus and Web of Science, Google Scholar does not maintain an Application Programming Interface that may be used to automate data retrieval. Use of web scrapers to obtain the contents of search results is also severely restricted by the implementation of rate limiters and CAPTCHAs. Google Scholar does not display or export Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), a de facto standard implemented by all major academic publishers to uniquely identify and refer to individual pieces of academic work.Search engine optimization (SEO) for traditional web search engines such as Google has been popular for many years. For several years, SEO has also been applied to academic search engines such as Google Scholar.[41] SEO for academic articles is also called \"academic search engine optimization\" (ASEO) and defined as \"the creation, publication, and modification of scholarly literature in a way that makes it easier for academic search engines to both crawl it and index it\".[41] ASEO has been adopted by organizations such as Elsevier,[42] OpenScience,[43] Mendeley,[44] and SAGE Publishing[45] to optimize their articles' rankings in Google Scholar. ASEO has negatives.[37]"

        "name": "Search",
        "text": "Google Search, also referred to as Google Web Search or simply Google, is a web search engine developed by Google. It is the most used search engine on the World Wide Web across all platforms, with 92.62% market share as of June 2019,[4] handling more than 5.4 billion searches each day.[5]The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called \"PageRank\". Google Search also provides many different options for customized search, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit and time conversions, word definitions, and more.The main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed in 1997 by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan.[6][7][8] In June 2011, Google introduced \"Google Voice Search\" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words.[9] In May 2012, Google introduced a Knowledge Graph semantic search feature in the U.S.Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends.[10] Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys. As of mid-2016, Google's search engine has begun to rely on deep neural networks.[11]Competitors of Google include Baidu and Soso.com in China; Naver.com and Daum.net in South Korea; Yandex in Russia; Seznam.cz in the Czech Republic; Qwant in France[12]; Yahoo in Japan, Taiwan and the US, as well as Bing and DuckDuckGo.[13] Some smaller search engines offer facilities not available with Google, e.g. not storing any private or tracking information.Within the U.S., as of July 2018, Bing handled 24.2 percent of all search queries. During the same period of time, Oath (formerly known as Yahoo) had a search market share of 11.5 percent. Market leader Google generated 63.2 percent of all core search queries in the U.S.[14]Google indexes hundreds of terabytes of information from web pages.[15] For websites that are currently down or otherwise not available, Google provides links to cached versions of the site, formed by the search engine's latest indexing of that page.[16] Additionally, Google indexes some file types, being able to show users PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, certain Flash multimedia content, and plain text files.[17] Users can also activate \"SafeSearch\", a filtering technology aimed at preventing explicit and pornographic content from appearing in search results.[18]Despite Google search's immense index, sources generally assume that Google is only indexing less than 5% of the total Internet, with the rest belonging to the deep web, inaccessible through its search tools.[15][19][20]In 2012, Google changed its search indexing tools to demote sites that had been accused of piracy.[21] In October 2016, Gary Illyes, a webmaster trends analyst with Google, announced that the search engine would be making a separate, primary web index dedicated for mobile devices, with a secondary, less up-to-date index for desktop use. The change was a response to the continued growth in mobile usage, and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile-friendly version of their websites.[22][23] In December 2017, Google began rolling out the change, having already done so for multiple websites.[24]In August 2009, Google invited web developers to test a new search architecture, codenamed \"Caffeine\", and give their feedback. The new architecture provided no visual differences in the user interface, but added significant speed improvements and a new \"under-the-hood\" indexing infrastructure. The move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to Microsoft's recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service, renamed Bing, as well as the launch of Wolfram Alpha, a new search engine based on \"computational knowledge\".[25][26] Google announced completion of \"Caffeine\" on June 8, 2010, claiming 50% fresher results due to continuous updating of its index.[27]With \"Caffeine\", Google moved its back-end indexing system away from MapReduce and onto Bigtable, the company's distributed database platform.[28][29]In August 2018, Danny Sullivan from Google announced a broad core algorithm update. As per current analysis done by the industry leaders Search Engine Watch and Search Engine Land, the update was to drop down the medical and health related websites that were not user friendly and were not providing good user experience. This is why the industry experts named it \"Medic\".[30]Google reserves very high standards for YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) pages. This is because misinformation can affect users financially, physically or emotionally. Therefore, the update targeted particularly those YMYL pages that have low-quality content and misinformation. This resulted in the algorithm targeting health and medical related websites more than others. However, many other websites from other industries were also negatively affected.[31]Google Search consists of a series of localized websites. The largest of those, the google.com site, is the top most-visited website in the world.[32] Some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words, the number of results you got on your search, links to other searches (e.g. for words that Google believes to be misspelled, it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling), and many more.Google search accepts queries as normal text, as well as individual keywords.[33] It automatically corrects misspelled words, and yields the same results regardless of capitalization.[33] For more customized results, one can use a wide variety of operators, including, but not limited to:[34][35]Google applies query expansion to submitted search queries, using techniques to deliver results that it considers \"smarter\" than the query users actually submitted. This technique involves several steps, including:[36]In 2008, Google started to give users autocompleted search suggestions in a list below the search bar while typing.[37]Google's homepage includes a button labeled \"I'm Feeling Lucky\". This feature originally allowed users to type in their search query, click the button and be taken directly to the first result, bypassing the search results page. With the 2010 announcement of Google Instant, an automatic feature that immediately displays relevant results as users are typing in their query, the \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" button disappears, requiring that users opt-out of Instant results through search settings in order to keep using the \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" functionality.[38] In 2012, \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" was changed to serve as an advertisement for Google services; users hover their computer mouse over the button, it spins and shows an emotion (\"I'm Feeling Puzzled\" or \"I'm Feeling Trendy\", for instance), and, when clicked, takes users to a Google service related to that emotion.[39]Tom Chavez of \"Rapt\", a firm helping to determine a website's advertising worth, estimated in 2007 that Google lost $110 million in revenue per year due to use of the button, which bypasses the advertisements found on the search results page.[40]Besides the main text-based search-engine features of Google search, it also offers multiple quick, interactive experiences. These include, but are not limited to:[41][42][43]During Google's developer conference, Google I/O, in May 2013, the company announced that, on Google Chrome and Chrome OS, users would be able to say \"OK Google\", with the browser initiating an audio-based search, with no button presses required. After having the answer presented, users can follow up with additional, contextual questions; an example include initially asking \"OK Google, will it be sunny in Santa Cruz this weekend?\", hearing a spoken answer, and reply with \"how far is it from here?\"[44][45] An update to the Chrome browser with voice-search functionality rolled out a week later, though it required a button press on a microphone icon rather than \"OK Google\" voice activation.[46] Google released a browser extension for the Chrome browser, named with a \"beta\" tag for unfinished development, shortly thereafter.[47] In May 2014, the company officially added \"OK Google\" into the browser itself;[48] they removed it in October 2015, citing low usage, though the microphone icon for activation remained available.[49] In May 2016, 20% of search queries on mobile devices were done through voice.[50]\"Universal search\" was launched by Google on May 16, 2007 as an idea that merged the results from different kinds of search types into one. Prior to Universal search, a standard Google search would consist of links only to websites. Universal search, however, incorporates a wide variety of sources, including websites, news, pictures, maps, blogs, videos, and more, all shown on the same search results page.[51][52] Marissa Mayer, then-vice president of search products and user experience, described the goal of Universal search as \"we're attempting to break down the walls that traditionally separated our various search properties and integrate the vast amounts of information available into one simple set of search results.[53]In June 2017, Google expanded its search results to cover available job listings. The data is aggregated from various major job boards and collected by analyzing company homepages. Initially only available in English, the feature aims to simplify finding jobs suitable for each user.[54][55]In May 2009, Google announced that they would be parsing website microformats in order to populate search result pages with \"Rich snippets\". Such snippets include additional details about results, such as displaying reviews for restaurants and social media accounts for individuals.[56]In May 2016, Google expanded on the \"Rich snippets\" format to offer \"Rich cards\", which, similarly to snippets, display more information about results, but shows them at the top of the mobile website in a swipeable carousel-like format.[57] Originally limited to movie and recipe websites in the United States only, the feature expanded to all countries globally in 2017.[58]Now the web publishers can have greater control over the rich snippets. Preview settings from these meta tags will become effective in mid-to-late October 2019 and may take about a week for the global rollout to complete. [59]The Knowledge Graph is a knowledge base used by Google to enhance its search engine's results with information gathered from a variety of sources.[60] This information is presented to users in a box to the right of search results.[61] Knowledge Graph boxes were added to Google's search engine in May 2012,[60] starting in the United States, with international expansion by the end of the year.[62] The information covered by the Knowledge Graph grew significantly after launch, tripling its original size within seven months,[63] and being able to answer \"roughly one-third\" of the 100 billion monthly searches Google processed in May 2016.[64] The information is often used as a spoken answer in Google Assistant[65] and Google Home searches.[66] The Knowledge Graph has been criticized for providing answers without source attribution.[64]In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.[67][68]The Google feed is a personalized stream of articles, videos, and other news-related content. The feed contains a \"mix of cards\" which show topics of interest based on users' interactions with Google, or topics they choose to follow directly.[69] Cards include, \"links to news stories, YouTube videos, sports scores, recipes, and other content based on what [Google] determined you're most likely to be interested in at that particular moment.\"[69] Users can also tell Google they're not interested in certain topics to avoid seeing future updates.The Google feed launched in December 2016[70] and received a major update in July 2017.[71] As of May 2018, the Google feed can be found on the Google app and by swiping left on the home screen of certain Android devices. As of 2019, Google will not allow political campaigns worldwide to target their advertisement to people to make them vote.[72]Google's rise was largely due to a patented algorithm called PageRank which helps rank web pages that match a given search string.[73] When Google was a Stanford research project, it was nicknamed BackRub because the technology checks backlinks to determine a site's importance. Other keyword-based methods to rank search results, used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google, would check how often the search terms occurred in a page, or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page. The PageRank algorithm instead analyzes human-generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are also important. The algorithm computes a recursive score for pages, based on the weighted sum of other pages linking to them. PageRank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance. In addition to PageRank, Google, over the years, has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of resulting pages. This is reported to comprise over 250 different indicators,[74][75] the specifics of which are kept secret to avoid difficulties created by scammers and help Google maintain an edge over its competitors globally.PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996. Larry Page's patent for PageRank filed in 1998 includes a citation to Li's earlier patent. Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu in 2000.[76][77][78]In a potential hint of Google's future direction of their Search algorithm, Google's then chief executive Eric Schmidt, said in a 2007 interview with the Financial Times: \"The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as 'What shall I do tomorrow?' and 'What job shall I take?'\".[79] Schmidt reaffirmed this during a 2010 interview with the Wall Street Journal: \"I actually think most people don't want Google to answer their questions, they want Google to tell them what they should be doing next.\"[80]In 2013 the European Commission found that Google Search favored Google's own products, instead of the best result for consumers' needs.[81] In February 2015 Google announced a major change to its mobile search algorithm which would favor mobile friendly over other websites. Nearly 60% of Google searches come from mobile phones. Google says it wants users to have access to premium quality websites. Those websites which lack a mobile friendly interface would be ranked lower and it is expected that this update will cause a shake-up of ranks. Businesses who fail to update their websites accordingly could see a dip in their regular websites traffic.[82]Because Google is the most popular search engine, many webmasters attempt to influence their website's Google rankings. An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and on other search engines. This field, called search engine optimization, attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings, and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their clients' sites. Search engine optimization encompasses both \"on page\" factors (like body copy, title elements, H1 heading elements and image alt attribute values) and Off Page Optimization factors (like anchor text and PageRank). The general idea is to affect Google's relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places \"on page\", in particular the title element and the body copy (note: the higher up in the page, presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking). Too many occurrences of the keyword, however, cause the page to look suspect to Google's spam checking algorithms. Google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants.[83] It has been hypothesized, and, allegedly, is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints, that negative publicity, for example, numerous consumer complaints, may serve as well to elevate page rank on Google Search as favorable comments.[84] The particular problem addressed in The New York Times article, which involved DecorMyEyes, was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the Google algorithm. According to Google, it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about DecorMyEyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it. Google Search Console helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright content.[85]In 2013, Google significantly upgraded its search algorithm with \"Hummingbird\". Its name was derived from the speed and accuracy of the hummingbird.[86] The change was announced on September 26, 2013, having already been in use for a month.[87] \"Hummingbird\" places greater emphasis on natural language queries, considering context and meaning over individual keywords.[86] It also looks deeper at content on individual pages of a website, with improved ability to lead users directly to the most appropriate page rather than just a website's homepage.[88] The upgrade marked the most significant change to Google search in years, with more \"human\" search interactions[89] and a much heavier focus on conversation and meaning.[86] Thus, web developers and writers were encouraged to optimize their sites with natural writing rather than forced keywords, and make effective use of technical web development for on-site navigation.[90]On certain occasions, the logo on Google's webpage will change to a special version, known as a \"Google Doodle\". This is a picture, drawing, animation or interactive game that includes the logo. It is usually done for a special event or day although not all of them are well known.[91] Clicking on the Doodle links to a string of Google search results about the topic. The first was a reference to the Burning Man Festival in 1998,[92][93] and others have been produced for the birthdays of notable people like Albert Einstein, historical events like the interlocking Lego block's 50th anniversary and holidays like Valentine's Day.[94] Some Google Doodles have interactivity beyond a simple search, such as the famous \"Google Pacman\" version that appeared on May 21, 2010.Google offers a \"Google Search\" mobile app for Android and iOS devices.[95] The mobile apps exclusively feature a \"feed\", a news feed-style page of continually-updated developments on news and topics of interest to individual users. Android devices were introduced to a preview of the feed in December 2016,[96] while it was made official on both Android and iOS in July 2017.[97][98]In April 2016, Google updated its Search app on Android to feature \"Trends\"; search queries gaining popularity appeared in the autocomplete box along with normal query autocompletion.[99] The update received significant backlash, due to encouraging search queries unrelated to users' interests or intentions, prompting the company to issue an update with an opt-out option.[100] In September 2017, the Google Search app on iOS was updated to feature the same functionality.[101]Until May 2013, Google Search had offered a feature to translate search queries into other languages. A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that \"Removing features is always tough, but we do think very hard about each decision and its implications for our users. Unfortunately, this feature never saw much pick up\".[102]Instant search was announced in September 2010 as a feature that displayed suggested results while the user typed in their search query. The primary advantage of the new system was its ability to save time, with Marissa Mayer, then-vice president of search products and user experience, proclaiming that the feature would save 2â5 seconds per search, elaborating that \"That may not seem like a lot at first, but it adds up. With Google Instant, we estimate that we'll save our users 11 hours with each passing second!\"[103] Matt Van Wagner of Search Engine Land wrote that \"Personally, I kind of like Google Instant and I think it represents a natural evolution in the way search works\", and also praised Google's efforts in public relations, writing that \"With just a press conference and a few well-placed interviews, Google has parlayed this relatively minor speed improvement into an attention-grabbing front-page news story\".[104] The upgrade also became notable for the company switching Google Search's underlying technology from HTML to AJAX.[105]Instant Search could be disabled via Google's \"preferences\" menu for those who didn't want its functionality.[106]The publication 2600: The Hacker Quarterly compiled a list of words that Google Instant did not show suggested results for, with a Google spokesperson giving the following statement to Mashable:[107]There are a number of reasons you may not be seeing search queries for a particular topic. Among other things, we apply a narrow set of removal policies for pornography, violence, and hate speech. It's important to note that removing queries from Autocomplete is a hard problem, and not as simple as blacklisting particular terms and phrases.In search, we get more than one billion searches each day. Because of this, we take an algorithmic approach to removals, and just like our search algorithms, these are imperfect. We will continue to work to improve our approach to removals in Autocomplete, and are listening carefully to feedback from our users.Our algorithms look not only at specific words, but compound queries based on those words, and across all languages. So, for example, if there's a bad word in Russian, we may remove a compound word including the transliteration of the Russian word into English. We also look at the search results themselves for given queries. So, for example, if the results for a particular query seem pornographic, our algorithms may remove that query from Autocomplete, even if the query itself wouldn't otherwise violate our policies. This system is neither perfect nor instantaneous, and we will continue to work to make it better.PC Magazine discussed the inconsistency in how some forms of the same topic are allowed; for instance, \"lesbian\" was blocked, while \"gay\" was not, and \"cocaine\" was blocked, while \"crack\" and \"heroin\" were not. The report further stated that seemingly normal words were also blocked due to pornographic innuendos, most notably \"scat\", likely due to having two completely separate contextual meanings, one for music and one for a sexual practice.[108]In July 2017, Google removed Instant results, due to a growing number of searches on mobile devices, where interaction with search, as well as screen sizes, differ significantly from a computer.[109][110]Various search engines provide encrypted Web search facilities. In May 2010 Google rolled out SSL-encrypted web search.[111] The encrypted search was accessed at encrypted.google.com[112] However, the web search is encrypted via Transport Layer Security (TLS) by default today, thus every search request should be automatically encrypted if TLS is supported by the web browser.[113] On its support website, Google announced that the address encrypted.google.com would be turned off April 30, 2018, stating that all Google products and most new browsers use HTTPS connections as the reason for the discontinuation.[114]Google Real-Time Search was a feature of Google Search in which search results also sometimes included real-time information from sources such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and news websites.[115] The feature was introduced on December 7, 2009[116] and went offline on July 2, 2011 after the deal with Twitter expired.[117] Real-Time Search included Facebook status updates beginning on February 24, 2010.[118] A feature similar to Real-Time Search was already available on Microsoft's Bing search engine, which showed results from Twitter and Facebook.[119] The interface for the engine showed a live, descending \"river\" of posts in the main region (which could be paused or resumed), while a bar chart metric of the frequency of posts containing a certain search term or hashtag was located on the right hand corner of the page above a list of most frequently reposted posts and outgoing links. Hashtag search links were also supported, as were \"promoted\" tweets hosted by Twitter (located persistently on top of the river) and thumbnails of retweeted image or video links.In January 2011, geolocation links of posts were made available alongside results in Real-Time Search. In addition, posts containing syndicated or attached shortened links were made searchable by the link: query option. In July 2011 Real-Time Search became inaccessible, with the Real-Time link in the Google sidebar disappearing and a custom 404 error page generated by Google returned at its former URL. Google originally suggested that the interruption was temporary and related to the launch of Google+;[120] they subsequently announced that it was due to the expiry of a commercial arrangement with Twitter to provide access to tweets.[121]Searches made by search engines, including Google, leave traces. This raises concerns about privacy. In principle, if details of a user's searches are found, those with access to the informationâprincipally state agencies responsible for law enforcement and similar mattersâcan make deductions about the user's activities. This has been used for the detection and prosecution of lawbreakers; for example a murderer was found and convicted after searching for terms such as \"tips with killing with a baseball bat\".[122]A search may leave traces both on a computer used to make the search, and in records kept by the search provider. When using a search engine through a browser program on a computer, search terms and other information may be stored on the computer by default, unless the browser is set not to do this, or they are erased. Saved terms may be discovered on forensic analysis of the computer. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) or search engine provider (e.g., Google) may store records which relate search terms to an IP address and a time.[123] Whether such logs are kept, and access to them by law enforcement agencies, is subject to legislation in different jurisdictions and working practices; the law may mandate, prohibit, or say nothing about logging of various types of information. Some search engines, located in jurisdictions where it is not illegal, make a feature of not storing user search information.[124]The keywords suggested by the Autocomplete feature show a population of users' research which is made possible by an identity management system. Volumes of personal data are collected via Eddystone web and proximity beacons.[citation needed]Google has been criticized for placing long-term cookies on users' machines to store these preferences, a tactic which also enables them to track a user's search terms and retain the data for more than a year.[125]Since 2012, Google Inc. has globally introduced encrypted connections for most of its clients, in order to bypass governative blockings of the commercial and IT services.[126]In late June 2011, Google introduced a new look to the Google home page in order to boost the use of the Google+ social tools.[127]One of the major changes was replacing the classic navigation bar with a black one. Google's digital creative director Chris Wiggins explains: \"We're working on a project to bring you a new and improved Google experience, and over the next few months, you'll continue to see more updates to our look and feel.\"[128] The new navigation bar has been negatively received by a vocal minority.[129]In November 2013, Google started testing yellow labels for advertisements displayed in search results, to improve user experience. The new labels, highlighted in yellow color, and aligned to the left of each sponsored link help users clearly differentiate between organic and sponsored results.[130]On December 15, 2016, Google rolled out a new desktop search interface that mimics their modular mobile user interface. The mobile design consists of a tabular design that highlights search features in boxes. and works by imitating the desktop Knowledge Graph real estate, which appears in the right-hand rail of the search engine result page, these featured elements frequently feature Twitter carousels, People Also Search For, and Top Stories (vertical and horizontal design) modules. The Local Pack and Answer Box were two of the original features of the Google SERP that were primarily showcased in this manner, but this new layout creates a previously unseen level of design consistency for Google results.[131]In addition to its tool for searching web pages, Google also provides services for searching images, Usenet newsgroups, news websites, videos, searching by locality, maps, and items for sale online. In 2012, Google has indexed over 30 trillion web pages, and received 100 billion queries per month.[132] It also caches much of the content that it indexes. Google operates other tools and services including Google News, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Custom Search, Google Earth, Google Docs, Picasa, Panoramio, YouTube, Google Translate, Google Blog Search and Google Desktop Search.There are also products available from Google that are not directly search-related. Gmail, for example, is a webmail application, but still includes search features; Google Browser Sync does not offer any search facilities, although it aims to organize your browsing time.Also Google starts many new beta products, like Google Social Search or Google Image Swirl.In 2009, Google claimed that a search query requires altogether about 1 kJ or 0.0003 kWÂ·h,[133] which is enough to raise the temperature of one liter of water by 0.24 Â°C. According to green search engine Ecosia, the industry standard for search engines is estimated to be about 0.2 grams of CO2 emission per search.[134] Google's 40,000 searches per second translate to 8 kg CO2 per second or over 252 million kilos of CO2 per year.[135]In 2003, The New York Times complained about Google's indexing, claiming that Google's caching of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.[136] In both Field v. Google and Parker v. Google, the United States District Court of Nevada ruled in favor of Google.[137][138]Google flags search results with the message \"This site may harm your computer\" if the site is known to install malicious software in the background or otherwise surreptitiously. For approximately 40 minutes on January 31, 2009, all search results were mistakenly classified as malware and could therefore not be clicked; instead a warning message was displayed and the user was required to enter the requested URL manually. The bug was caused by human error.[139][140][141][142] The URL of \"/\" (which expands to all URLs) was mistakenly added to the malware patterns file.[140][141]In 2007, a group of researchers observed a tendency for users to rely on Google Search exclusively for finding information, writing that \"With the Google interface the user gets the impression that the search results imply a kind of totality. ... In fact, one only sees a small part of what one could see if one also integrates other research tools.\"[143]In 2011, Google Search query results have been shown to be tailored to users by Internet activist Eli Pariser, effectively isolating users in what he defined as a filter bubble. Pariser holds algorithms used in search engines such as Google Search responsible for catering \"a personal ecosystem of information\".[144] Although contrasting views have mitigated the potential threat of \"informational dystopia\" and questioned the scientific nature of Pariser's claims,[145] filter bubbles have been mentioned to account for the surprising results of the U.S. presidential election in 2016 alongside fake news and echo chambers, suggesting that Facebook and Google have designed personalized online realities in which \"we only see and hear what we like\".[146]In 2012, the US Federal Trade Commission fined Google US$22.5 million for violating their agreement not to violate the privacy of users of Apple's Safari web browser.[147] The FTC was also continuing to investigate if Google's favoring of their own services in their search results violated antitrust regulations.[148]Google search engine robots are programmed to use algorithms that understand and predict human behavior. The book, Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code[149] by Ruha Benjamin talks about human bias as a behavior that the google search engine can recognize. In 2016, some users google searched âthree Black teenagersâ and images of criminal mugshots of young African American teenagers came up. Then, the users searched âthree White teenagersâ and were presented with photos of smiling, happy teenagers. They also searched for âthree Asian teenagers,â and very revealing photos of asian girls and women appeared. Benjamin came to the conclusion that these results reflect human prejudice and views on different ethnic groups. A group of analysts explained the concept of a racist computer program: âThe idea here is that computers, unlike people, canât be racist but weâre increasingly learning that they do in fact take after their makers...Some experts believe that this problem might stem from the hidden biases in the massive piles of data that the algorithms process as they learn to recognize patterns...reproducing our worst valuesâ[149].As people talk about \"googling\" rather than searching, the company has taken some steps to defend its trademark, in an effort to prevent if from becoming a generic trademark.[150][151] This has led to lawsuits, threats of lawsuits, and the use of euphemisms, such as calling Google Search a famous web search engine."

        "name": "Sheets",
        "text": "Google Sheets is a spreadsheet program included as part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by Google within its Google Drive service. The service also includes Google Docs and Google Slides, a word processor and presentation program respectively. Google Sheets is available as a web application, mobile app for Android, iOS, Windows, BlackBerry, and as a desktop application on Google's ChromeOS. The app is compatible with Microsoft Excel file formats.[2] The app allows users to create and edit files online while collaborating with other users in real-time. Edits are tracked by user with a revision history presenting changes. An editor's position is highlighted with an editor-specific color and cursor and a permissions system regulates what users can do. Updates have introduced features using machine learning, including \"Explore\", offering answers based on natural language questions in a spreadsheet.Google Sheets originated from XL2Web, a web-based spreadsheet application developed by 2Web Technologies, which was acquired by Google in 2006[3] and turned into Google Labs Spreadsheets. It was launched as a test for a limited number of users, on a first-come, first-served basis on June 6, 2006.[4][5] The limited test was later replaced with a beta version available to all Google Account holders, around the same time as an official announcement press release was issued.[6] In March 2010, Google acquired the online document collaboration company DocVerse. DocVerse allowed multiple-user online collaboration on Excel-compatible document as well as other Microsoft Office formats such as Word and PowerPoint.[7] Improvements based on DocVerse were announced and deployed in April 2010.[8] In June 2012, Google acquired Quickoffice, a freeware proprietary productivity suite for mobile devices.[9] In October 2012, Google Spreadsheets was renamed Google Sheets and a Chrome app was released that provided shortcuts to Sheets on Chrome's new tab page.[10]Google Sheets is available as a web application supported on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari web browsers.[11] Users can access all spreadsheets, among other files, collectively through the Google Drive website. In June 2014, Google rolled out a dedicated website homepage for Sheets that contain only files created with Sheets.[12] In 2014, Google launched a dedicated mobile app for Sheets on the Android and iOS mobile operating systems.[13][14][15] In 2015, the mobile website for Sheets was updated with a \"simpler, more uniform\" interface, and while users can read spreadsheets through the mobile websites, users trying to edit will be redirected towards the mobile app to eliminate editing on the mobile web.[16]Google Sheets serves as a collaborative tool for cooperative editing of spreadsheets in real-time. Documents can be shared, opened, and edited by multiple users simultaneously and users are able to see character-by-character changes as other collaborators make edits. Changes are automatically saved to Google's servers, and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed and reverted to.[18] An editor's current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing that part of the document they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows collaborators to discuss edits. The revision history allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color. Only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. Files can be exported to a user's local computer in a variety of formats such as PDF and Office Open XML[19]. Sheets supports tagging for archival and organizational purposes.Launched for the entire Drive suite in September 2016, \"Explore\" enables additional functionality through machine learning.[20][21][22] In Google Sheets, Explore enables users to ask questions, such as \"How many units were sold on Black Friday?\", and Explore will return the answer, without requiring formula knowledge from the user. In June 2017, Google expanded the Explore feature in Google Sheets to automatically build charts and visualize data,[23][24] and again expanded it in December to feature machine learning capable of automatically creating pivot tables.[25][26] In October 2016, Google announced the addition of \"Action items\" to Sheets. If a user assigns a task within a Sheet, the service will intelligently assign that action to the designated user. Google states this will make it easier for other collaborators to visualize who is responsible for a task. When a user visits Google Drive or Sheets, any files containing tasks assigned to them will be highlighted with a badge.[27] In March 2014, Google introduced add-ons; new tools from third-party developers that add more features for Google Sheets.[28]In order to view and edit spreadsheets offline on a computer, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser. A Chrome extension, Google Docs Offline, allows users to enable offline support for Sheets and other Drive suite files on the Google Drive website.[29] The Android and iOS apps natively support offline editing.[30][31]Files in the following formats can be viewed and converted to the Sheets format: .xls (if newer than Microsoft Office 95), .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlt, .xltx, .xltm .ods, .csv, .tsv, .txt, .tab[32] Overall document size is capped at 5 million cells.[33][34]The Sheets app and the rest of the Drive suite are free to use for individuals, but Sheets is also available as part of the business-centered G Suite service by Google, which is a monthly subscription that enables additional business-focused functionality.[35]A simple find and replace tool is available. The service includes a web clipboard tool that allows users to copy and paste content between Google Sheets and Docs, Slides, and Drawings. The web clipboard can also be used for copying and pasting content between different computers. Copied items are stored on Google's servers for up to 30 days.[36] Google offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called Office editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides that enables users to view and edit Microsoft Excel documents on Google Chrome, via the Sheets app. The extension can be used for opening Excel files stored on the computer using Chrome, as well as for opening files encountered on the web (in the form of email attachments, web search results, etc.) without having to download them. The extension is installed on Chrome OS by default.[37] As of June 2019, this extension is no longer required since the functionality exists natively.[38]Google Cloud Connect was a plug-in for Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and 2010 that could automatically store and synchronize any Excel document to Google Sheets (before the introduction of Drive). The online copy was automatically updated each time the Microsoft Excel document was saved. Microsoft Excel documents could be edited offline and synchronized later when online. Google Cloud Connect maintained previous Microsoft Excel document versions and allowed multiple users to collaborate by working on the same document at the same time.[39][40] However, Google Cloud Connect has been discontinued as of April 30, 2013, as, according to Google, Google Drive achieves all of the above tasks, \"with better results\".[41]While Microsoft Excel maintains the 1900 Leap year bug. Google sheets 'fixes' this bug by increasing all dates prior to March 1, 1900, so entering \"0\" and formatting it as a date returns December 30, 1899. On the other hand. Excel treats \"0\" as December 31, 1899, which is formatted to read January 0, 1900."

        "text": "Google Sites is a structured wiki- and Web page-creation tool offered by Google.The declared goal of Google Sites is for anyone to be able to create simple web sites that support collaboration between different editors.[1]Google Sites started out as JotSpot, the name and sole product of a software company that offered enterprise social software. It was targeted mainly at small-sized and medium-sized businesses. The company was founded by Joe Kraus and Graham Spencer, co-founders of Excite.In February 2006, JotSpot was named part of Business 2.0, \"Next Net 25\",[2] and in May 2006, it was honored as one of InfoWorld's \"15 Start-ups to Watch\".[3] In October 2006, JotSpot was acquired by Google.[4] Google announced a prolonged data transition of webpages created using Google Page Creator (also known as \"Google Pages\") to Google Sites servers in 2007. On February 28, 2008, Google Sites was unveiled using the JotSpot technology.[5] The service was free, but users needed a domain name, which Google offered for $10. However, as of May 21, 2008, Google Sites became available for free, separately from Google Apps, and without the need for a domain.[6]In June 2016, Google introduced a complete rebuild of the Google Sites platform, named New Google Sites,[7][8] along with transition schedule from Classic Google Sites.[9]Following a regional Turkish court ruling in 2009, all pages hosted on Google Sites were blocked in Turkey. It was done after one of the pages contained an alleged insult of Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk. In 2012 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled this a breach of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (Yildirim v Turkey, 2012).[11] The ban was lifted in 2014.[12]"

        "text": "Google Slides is a presentation program included as part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by Google within its Google Drive service. The service also includes Google Docs and Google Sheets, a word processor and spreadsheet respectively. Google Slides is available as a web application, mobile app for Android, iOS, Windows, BlackBerry, and as a desktop application on Google's ChromeOS. The app is compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint file formats.[2]Slides allows users to create and edit presentations online while collaborating with other users in real-time. Edits are tracked by user with a revision history that tracks changes to the presentation. Each editor's position is highlighted with an editor-specific color/cursor and the system regulates what users can do through varying degrees of permissions. Updates have introduced features using machine learning, including \"Explore\", offering suggested layouts and images for presentations, and \"Action items\", allowing users to assign tasks to other users.[3]In September 2007, Google released a presentation program for Google Suite,[4][5] which originated from the company's acquisition of Tonic Systems on April 17, 2007.[6] In March 2010, Google acquired DocVerse, an online document collaboration company that allowed online collaboration between multiple users on Microsoft PowerPoint and other Microsoft Office-compatible document formats such as Word and Excel.[7] Improvements based on DocVerse were announced and deployed in April 2010.[8] In June 2012, Google acquired Quickoffice, a freeware proprietary productivity suite for mobile devices.[9] In October 2012, Google Presentations was renamed Google Slides and a Chrome app was released, which provided shortcuts to Slides on Chrome's new tab page.[10]Google Slides is available as a web application supported on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari web browsers.[11] Users can access presentations, as well as other files, through the Google Drive website. In June 2014, Google rolled out a dedicated website homepage for Slides that contained only files created using the Drive suite.[12] In 2014, Google launched a dedicated mobile app for Slides for the Android and iOS mobile operating systems.[13][14][15] In 2015, the mobile website for Slides was updated with a \"simpler, more uniform\" interface, and while users can read files through the mobile websites, users trying to edit presentations will be redirected towards the dedicated mobile app for Slides, thus preventing editing on the mobile web.[16]Slides serves as a collaborative tool for cooperative editing of presentations in real-time. Presentations can be shared, opened, and edited by multiple users simultaneously and users are able to see slide-by-slide and character-by-character changes as other collaborators make edits. Changes are automatically saved to Google's servers, and a revision history is automatically kept and users have the option of reverting to previous versions.[18]An editor's current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing the same slide, they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows collaborators to discuss edits. The revision history allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color. Only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. Files can be exported to a user's local computer in a variety of formats, including HTML, .jpg, and PDF.Launched in September 2016, \"Explore\" provides additional functionality to the Drive suite through machine learning.[19][20][21] In Google Slides, Explore dynamically generates design suggestions based on the contents of each slide. The \"Explore\" features in the Drive suite follow the launch of a more basic research tool originally introduced in 2012.[22][23][24]In October 2016, Google announced the addition of \"Action items\" to Slides. If a user writes the name of a person the presentation is shared with in a comment, the service will intelligently assign that action to the person. Google states this will make it easier for other collaborators to see who is responsible for individual tasks. When a user visits Google Sheets or any of the other Google Drive applications, any files with tasks assigned to them will be highlighted with a badge.[25]In March 2014, Google introduced add-ons; new tools from third-party developers that adds more features to Google Sheets.[26]In order to view and edit presentations offline, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser. A Chrome extension, Google Docs Offline, allows users to enable offline support for Slides files on the Google Drive website.[27] The Android and iOS apps natively support offline editing.[28][29]Google Slides presentations can be saved as .ppt (if newer than Microsoft Office 95), .pptx, .pptm, .pps, .ppsx, .ppsm, .pot, .potx, and .potm.[30] Google Slides presentation files converted to .gslides Slides format cannot be larger than 100 MB. Images inserted cannot be larger than 50 MB, and must be in either .jpg, .png, or non-animated .gif formats.[31][32]The Google Slides app is free to use for individuals, but it is also available as part of the business-centered G Suite service by Google, which is a monthly subscription that enables additional business-focused functionality.[33]A simple find and replace tool is available, and like all Google Drive suite programs, Slides includes a web clipboard tool that allows users to copy and paste content between Slides and the other Drive apps. The web clipboard can also be used for copying and pasting content between different computers. Copied items are stored on Google's servers for up to 30 days. For most copying and pasting, Google Slides also supports keyboard shortcuts, but sometimes due to them supporting this they will only let you use keyboard shortcuts.[34]Google offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called Office editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides that enables users to view and edit PowerPoint and other Microsoft Office documents on Google Chrome, via the Sheets app. The extension can be used for opening Office files stored on the computer using Chrome, as well as for opening Office files encountered on the web (in the form of email attachments, web search results, etc.) without having to download them. The extension is installed on Chrome OS by default.[35]Google Cloud Connect was a plug-in for Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and 2010 that could automatically store and synchronize any PowerPoint presentation to Google Docs (before the introduction of Drive) in the Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint formats. The online copy was automatically updated each time the PowerPoint document was saved. PowerPoint documents could be edited offline and synchronized later when online. Google Cloud Connect maintained previous document versions and allowed multiple users to collaborate by working on the same document at the same time.[36][37] Google Cloud Connect has been discontinued as of April 30, 2013, as, according to Google, Google Drive achieves all of the above tasks, \"with better results\".[38]"

        "text": "Tilt Brush is a room-scale 3D-painting virtual-reality application available from Google, originally developed by Skillman & Hackett.The Preview Trailer from September 2014 (a 1'47â³ video) conveys an impression of the nature of Tilt Brush.The application is designed for 6DoF motion interfaces in virtual reality but also works with keyboard and mouse. The keyboard and mouse version is not publicly available. It's purely for development purposes.[1] Users are presented with a virtual palette from which they can select from a variety of brush types and colors.[2] Movement of the handheld controller in 3D space creates brush strokes that follow in the virtual environment.[3] Users can export their creations of room-scale VR pieces in .fbx, .usd, and a .json format. They can also capture snapshots, animated GIF images, .mpeg videos, or render 360 degree videos.[4]Tilt Brush was developed by Skillman & Hackett, and was in 2014 nominated for four Proto Awards (namely: \"Best Interaction Design\", \"Most Innovative\", \"Best Overall Virtual Reality Application\", and \"Best GUI\"), of which it won the \"Best GUI\" award. [5] [6] Google acquired Tilt Brush in 2015, as announced April 16, 2015 [7]. Tilt Brush was released for the HTC Vive at its launch on April 5, 2016, at no cost when pre-ordering the HTC Vive.[8][9]. On February 24, 2017, Tilt VR announced it is now available on both Oculus Rift and Vive.[10]In the Fast Company article about Tilt Brush[11], one of the creators said that the idea of drawing in 3D space came from a chess game prototype: âThere was a happy accident. Tilt Brush came out of an experiment with a virtual reality chess prototype, where we accidentally started painting the chess pieces in the air, and it was incredibleâ. In the earlier versions of Tilt Brush, it was only possible to draw on two-dimensional planes.Ars Technica and other sites referred to Tilt Brush as the HTC Vive's killer app,[12][13][14][15][16] praising the program's intuitive interface and the excitement of painting in three dimensions.[17] Edward Baig of USA Today said that the program was the only one that excited him in the platform's launch lineup.[18] Chris Suellentrop of The New York Times wrote that the program was better suited for beginners than more engineering-oriented experiences like Fantastic Contraption.[19] In 2018, Tilt Brush was employed for the first time in mixed reality news reporting by the NBC News studio NBC Left Field.[20]"

        "name": "Translate",
        "text": "Google Translate is a free multilingual machine translation service developed by Google, to translate text. It offers a website interface, mobile apps for Android and iOS, and an API that helps developers build browser extensions and software applications. Google Translate supports over 100 languages at various levels and as of May 2017, serves over 500 million people daily.Launched in April 2006 as a statistical machine translation service, it used United Nations and European Parliament transcripts to gather linguistic data. Rather than translating languages directly, it first translates text to English and then to the target language. During a translation, it looks for patterns in millions of documents to help decide on the best translation. Its accuracy has been criticized and ridiculed on several occasions. In November 2016, Google announced that Google Translate would switch to a neural machine translation engine - Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) - which translates \"whole sentences at a time, rather than just piece by piece. It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation, which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar\". Originally only enabled for a few languages in 2016, GNMT is currently available in 105 languages as of 2019.Google Translate is a complementary translation service developed by Google in April 2006.[3] It translates multiple forms of texts and media such as words, phrases and webpages.Originally Google Translate was released as a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).[3] Translating the required text into English before translating into the selected language was a mandatory step that it had to take.[3] Since SMT uses predictive algorithms to translate text, it had poor grammatical accuracy. However, Google initially did not hire experts to resolve this limitation due to the ever-evolving nature of language.[3]In January 2010, Google has introduced an Android app and iOS version in February 2011 to serve as a portable personal interpreter.[3] As of February 2010, it was integrated into browsers such as Chrome and was able to pronounce the text, automatically recognize words in the picture and spot unfamiliar text and languages.[3]In May 2014, Google acquired Word Lens to improve the quality of visual and voice translation.[4] It is able to scan text or picture with one's device and have it translated instantly. Moreover, the system automatically identifies foreign languages and translates speech without requiring individuals to tap the mic button whenever speech translation is needed.[4]In November 2016, Google transitioned its translating method to a system called âNeural Machine Translation.â[5] It uses Deep Learning techniques to translate the whole sentences at a time and ensures more adequate accuracy of the context.[3]As of 2018, it translates more than 100 billion words a day.[5]Google Translate can translate multiple forms of text and media, which includes text, speech, images, and videos. Specifically, its functions include:For most of its features, Google Translate provides the pronunciation, dictionary, and listen to translation. Additionally, Google Translate has introduced its own Translate app, so translation is available with mobile phone in offline mode.[9]Google Translate can translate multiple forms of text and media, including text, speech, images, sites, or real-time video, from one language to another.[12][13] It supports over 100 languages at various levels[14] and as of May 2017, serves over 500 million people daily.[15] For some languages, Google Translate can pronounce translated text,[16] highlight corresponding words and phrases in the source and target text, and act as a simple dictionary for single-word input. If \"Detect language\" is selected, text in an unknown language can be automatically identified. If a user enters a URL in the source text, Google Translate will produce a hyperlink to a machine translation of the website.[17] Users can save translations in a \"phrasebook\" for later use.[18] For some languages, text can be entered via an on-screen keyboard, through handwriting recognition, or speech recognition.[19][20]Google Translate is available in some web browsers as an optional downloadable extension that can run the translation engine.[21] In February 2010, Google Translate was integrated into the Google Chrome browser by default, for optional automatic webpage translation.[22]The Google Translate app for Android and iOS supports more than 100 languages and can translate 37 languages via photo, 32 via voice in \"conversation mode\", and 27 via real-time video in \"augmented reality mode\".[25]The Android app was released in January 2010, and for iOS on February 8, 2011.[26]A January 2011 Android version experimented with a \"Conversation Mode\" that allowed users to communicate fluidly with a nearby person in another language.[27] Originally limited to English and Spanish, the feature received support for 12 new languages, still in testing, the following October.[28]In January 2015, the apps gained the ability to translate physical signs in real time using the device's camera, as a result of Google's acquisition of the Word Lens app.[29][30] The original January launch only supported seven languages, but a July update added support for 20 new languages, and also enhanced the speed of Conversation Mode translations.[31][32]In May 2011, Google announced that the Google Translate API for software developers had been deprecated and would cease functioning.[33] The Translate API page stated the reason as \"substantial economic burden caused by extensive abuse\" with an end date set for December 1, 2011.[34] In response to public pressure, Google announced in June 2011 that the API would continue to be available as a paid service.[35]Because the API was used in numerous third-party websites and apps, the original decision to deprecate it led some developers to criticize Google and question the viability of using Google APIs in their products.[36][37]Google Translate also provides translations for Google Assistant and the devices that Google Assistant runs on such as Google Home and Google Pixel Buds.The following languages are supported in Google Translate.[14]In April 2006, Google Translate launched with a statistical machine translation engine.[1]Google Translate does not apply grammatical rules, since its algorithms are based on statistical analysis rather than traditional rule-based analysis. The system's original creator, Franz Josef Och, has criticized the effectiveness of rule-based algorithms in favor of statistical approaches.[51] It is based on a method called statistical machine translation, and more specifically, on research by Och who won the DARPA contest for speed machine translation in 2003. Och was the head of Google's machine translation group until leaving to join Human Longevity, Inc. in July 2014.[52]According to Och, a solid base for developing a usable statistical machine translation system for a new pair of languages from scratch would consist of a bilingual text corpus (or parallel collection) of more than 150-200 million words, and two monolingual corpora each of more than a billion words.[51] Statistical models from these data are then used to translate between those languages.To acquire this huge amount of linguistic data, Google used United Nations and European Parliament transcripts.[53][54]Google Translate does not translate from one language to another (L1 â L2). Instead, it often translates first to English and then to the target language (L1 â EN â L2).[55]When Google Translate generates a translation, it looks for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents to help decide on the best translation. By detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators, Google Translate makes intelligent guesses as to what an appropriate translation should be.[56]Before October 2007, for languages other than Arabic, Chinese and Russian, Google Translate was based on SYSTRAN, a software engine which is still used by several other online translation services such as Babel Fish (now defunct). Since October 2007, Google Translate has used proprietary, in-house technology based on statistical machine translation instead.[57][58]Google constantly seeks for volunteers to be a part of its âTranslate Communityâ to translate languages people speak and help improve Google Translate's accuracy.[59] There are two ways to contribute. First, Google will show a phrase then one should type in the translated version.[59] Second, Google will show all possible translation for a phrase for individuals to click the right translation.[59]Although, Google deployed a new system called âNeural Machine Translationâ for better quality translation, there are languages that still use the traditional translation method called âStatistical Machine Translation.â It is a ârule-basedâ translation method that utilizes predictive algorithms to guess ways to translate texts in foreign languages. It aims to translate whole phrases rather than single words then gather overlapping phrases for translation. Moreover, it also analyzes bilingual text corpora to generate statistical model that translates texts from one language to another.[60]In September 2016, a research team at Google led by the software engineer Harold Gilchrist announced the development of the Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT) to increase fluency and accuracy in Google Translate[2][61] and in November announced that Google Translate would switch to GNMT.Google Translate's neural machine translation system uses a large end-to-end artificial neural network capable of deep learning,[2][62] in particular, long short-term memory networks.[63][64][65][66] GNMT improves the quality of translation because it uses an example-based machine translation (EBMT) method in which the system \"learns from millions of examples.\"[62] It translates \"whole sentences at a time, rather than just piece by piece. It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation, which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar\".[2] GNMT's \"proposed architecture\" of \"system learning\" was first tested on over a hundred languages supported by Google Translate.[62] With the end-to-end framework, \"the system learns over time to create better, more natural translations.\"[2] The GNMT network is capable of interlingual machine translation, which encodes the \"semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations\",[62][67] and the system did not invent its own universal language, but uses \"the commonality found inbetween many languages\".[68] GNMT was first enabled for eight languages: to and from English and Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish.[2][61] In March 2017, it was enabled for Hindi, Russian and Vietnamese languages,[69] followed by Indonesian, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu languages in April.[70]GNMT has the capability to translate directly from one language to another (L1 â L2), which improves upon the previous versions of Google Translate which first translated to English and then to the target language (L1 â EN â L2).[67] The GNMT system is also capable of Zero-Shot Translation - translating between a language pair (for example, Japanese to Korean) which the \"system has never explicitly seen before.\"[62]In 2014, Google launched \"Translate Community\", a platform aimed at improving the translation service by seeking help from volunteers.[71][72] In August 2016, a Google Crowdsource app was released for Android users, in which translation tasks are offered.[73][74]Although Google Translate is not as reliable as human translation, it can provide relatively accurate translation and a gist of foreign language text. It can translate text with the general use of words and phrases in a consistent manner.[75] Research conducted in 2011 showed that Google Translate got a slightly higher score than the UCLA minimum score for the English Proficiency Exam.[76] Due to its identical choice of words without considering the flexibility of choosing alternative words or expressions, it produces a relatively similar translation to human translation from the perspective of formality, referential cohesion, and conceptual cohesion.[77] Moreover, a number of languages are translated into a sentence structure and sentence length similar to a human translation.[77] Furthermore, Google carried out a test that required native speakers of each language to rate the translation on a scale between 0 and 6, and Google Translate scored 5.43 on average.[75]Due to the differences between languages in complexity and nature, the accuracy varies greatly between languages.[78] Some languages produce better results than others. Typically, western languages such as English and Spanish are generally accurate, but the accuracy of African languages is often the poorest, followed by Asian and European languages.[79] Moreover, Google Translate performs well especially when English is the target language and the source language is from the European Union, due to the prominence of translated EU Parliament notes. A 2010 analysis indicated that French to English translation is relatively accurate.[80]However, if the source text is shorter, rule-based machine translations often perform better; this effect is particularly evident in Chinese to English translations. While edits of translations may be submitted, in Chinese specifically one cannot edit sentences as a whole. Instead, one must edit sometimes arbitrary sets of characters, leading to incorrect edits.[80] A good example is Russian-to-English. Formerly one would use Google Translate to make a draft and then use a dictionary and common sense to correct the numerous mistakes. As of early 2018 Translate is sufficiently accurate to make the Russian Wikipedia accessible to those who can read English. The quality of Translate can be checked by adding it as an extension to Chrome or Firefox and applying it to the left language links of any Wikipedia article. It can be used as a dictionary by typing in words. One can translate from a book by using a scanner and an OCR like Google Drive, but this takes about five minutes per page.Once Google Translate has deployed a new technology called Neural Machine Translation to translate whole sentences or text block in the context at a time, alternative translations for a word or phrase are no longer available.[6] Moreover, in its Written Words Translation function, there is a word limit on the amount of text that can be translated at once.[6] Therefore, long text should be transferred to a document form and translated through its Document Translate function.[6]Moreover, machine translation often does not identify the double meanings of a word.[81] A word in a foreign language might have two different meanings in the translated language. This might lead to mistranslations.Additionally, grammatical errors remain a major limitation to the accuracy of Google Translate.[citation needed]Shortly after launching the translation service for the first time, Google won an international competition for EnglishâArabic and EnglishâChinese machine translation.[82]Since Google Translate used statistical matching to translate, translated text can often include apparently nonsensical and obvious errors,[83] sometimes swapping common terms for similar but nonequivalent common terms in the other language,[84] or inverting sentence meaning. Novelty websites like Bad Translator and Translation Party have utilized the service to produce humorous text by translating back and forth between multiple languages, similar to the children's game telephone.[85]In 2017 Oct 4 the system Google Translate was used during a court hearing when court officials at Teesside Magistrates' Court failed to book an interpreter for a Chinese defendant.[86]"

        "name": "Voice",
        "text": "Google Voice is a telephone service that provides call forwarding and voicemail services, voice and text messaging, as well as U.S. and international call termination[when defined as?] for Google Account customers[1] in the U.S., Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK[2]. The service was launched by Google[3] on March 11, 2009, after the company had acquired the service GrandCentral.Google Voice provides a U.S. telephone number, chosen by the user from available numbers in selected area codes, free of charge to each user account. Calls to this number are forwarded to telephone numbers that each user must configure in the account web portal. Multiple destinations may be specified that ring simultaneously for incoming calls. Service establishment requires a United States telephone number. A user may answer and receive calls on any of the ringing phones as configured in the web portal. During a received call the user may switch between the configured telephones.[4]Users in the U.S. may place outbound calls to domestic and international destinations. Calls may be initiated from any of the configured telephones, as well as from a mobile device app, or from the account portal.[4] As of August 2011, users in many other countries also may place outbound calls from the web-based application to domestic and international phone numbers.[5]Many other Google Voice servicesâsuch as voicemail, free text messaging, call history, conference calling, call screening, blocking of unwanted calls, and voice transcription to text of voicemail messagesâare also available to U.S. residents.[6] In terms of product integration, transcribed and audio voicemails, missed call notifications, and/or text messages can optionally be forwarded to an email account of the user's choice. Additionally, text messages can be sent and received via the familiar email or IM interface by reading and writing text messages in numbers in Google Talk respectively (PC-to-Phone texting). Google Voice multi-way videoconferencing (with support for document sharing) is now integrated with Google+ Hangouts.[7]The service is configured and maintained by the user in a web-based application, styled after Google's e-mail service, Gmail, or with Android and iOS apps on smart phones or tablets. Google Voice currently provides free PC-to-phone calling within the United States and Canada, and PC-to-PC voice and video calling worldwide between users of the Google+ Hangouts browser plugin (available for Windows, Intel-based Mac OS X, and Linux).[8]Almost all domestic and outbound calls to the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) and Canada[9][10][11] are currently free from the U.S. and Canada, and $0.01 per minute from everywhere else.[12] International calls are billed according to a schedule posted on the Google Voice website.[13]Late in 2009, Google Voice had approximately 1.4 million users, of which 570,000 used the service 7 days a week.[14] This number rose markedly after Google made the transition of its Google Voice service from \"invitation only\" to be available to all Gmail subscribers in the United States. A Wired blog post quoted a figure of 3.5 million in 2013.[15]Google Account customers in most other countries other than the U.S. and Canada may only access the call termination services through the integration with Google Hangouts.Google provides free PC-to-PC voice calling worldwide. As described above, Google Voice users in many countries may make low-cost calls to international phone numbers, and currently may also make free PC-to-phone calls within the United States and Canada. Vincent Paquet, a co-founder of GrandCentral who became a senior product manager at Google, said in 2009 that he expected Google Voice domestic service to remain free because the cost of operation is so low and, \"We can generate enough revenue from international calling to support the service.\"[16] Several years after this prediction, the service remains free of charge.A Google Voice local phone number for incoming calls is currently available only for users in the United States.[17] Users may select a single U.S. phone number from various area codes. Incoming calls to the number may ring simultaneously any of the user's configured phones or the account's Google Talk feature. Based on the calling number, or contact group (e.g., Family, Friends, Work), or on time of day (e.g., disabling a home phone during business hours and routing calls to mobile or business number), individual numbers may be configured to ring. The service also features voicemail with indexable automated voicemail transcription, accessible via a web browser, e-mail, or by phone. Google Voice provides automatic blocking of known numbers, e.g., telemarketers, the ability to switch lines in mid-call, differentiated voice mail greetings based on caller, Short Message Service (SMS) forwarding, and call recording.Previously, customers of Gizmo5, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) service vendor acquired by Google, were allowed to forward calls to their Gizmo service which may be answered using a free computer application, or a web application, or SIP-based telephone hardware.[18] Google discontinued Gizmo5 service on April 3, 2011.There are several competing virtual number services, such as eVoice. Personal numbering services have been available in the United Kingdom since 1993, similar to the AT&T True Connections 500 service offered in the 1990s in the United States. AT&T's service required the direct involvement of AT&T to change the phone number list, while the Google service is user-configurable on the web application.The original voice of GrandCentral and Google Voice belonged to actress and voice-over artist, Laurie Burke [1], but has been replaced with recordings by Kiki Baessell, a Googler who had no experience in professional voice-overs, but was chosen because of her pleasant, familiar voice.[19]GrandCentral, founded in 2005 by Craig Walker and Vincent Paquet with funding by Minor Ventures, was acquired by Google on July 2, 2007, for US$95 million in a transaction led by Miles Agha. Although Grand Central users were able to continue to use the service after the purchase, new users were not accepted, and Google made no public statements about their plans for the service.[4] On March 11, 2009, the management of the service revealed that the team had been working on it throughout that period, apparently in secret,[4] and that it was being rebranded \"Google Voice\".[20] It was to keep most of the functionality originally offered in GrandCentral and add new features. A previous design consultant, Peter Bouchard, was brought on to make changes and help relaunch the service.[21][22]Google Voice was launched on March 11, 2009, based on GrandCentral, with new features, including voicemail transcriptions and SMS managing. However, GrandCentral's Ringback Tone feature was not transitioned over to Google Voice. Google transitioned former GrandCentral accounts to Google Voice[20] and announced that the service would start accepting new members \"within weeks\" of the announcement.[4][20] On June 25, 2009, NBC's Today Show stated that Google Voice would be available nationwide on that day.[23] Google confirmed this in a Twitter message stating: \"Google Voice on NBC Today Show. Invites to people on reservations list starting to go out today.\"[24] The expansion was at first limited to users queued[25] on the invitation list.[26] Users with paid-in balances also received a limited number of invitation opportunities.On July 1, 2009, Google Voice provided the option for users to change their service phone number for a U.S. $10 fee.[27]On September 15, 2009, GrandCentral calling services were discontinued. Subscribers who used the website could still log into the site to retrieve old messages and data.[28] After termination of GrandCentral phone services, users who haven't moved over to Google Voice were still advised to upgrade their account to Google Voice.[29]On November 12, 2009, Google announced that it had acquired Gizmo5[30] for a reported U.S. $30 million in cash.[31] A major effect of this announcement was that Gizmo5 suspended new signups pending re-launch by Google.[32] Google was reported to be working on a desktop application, though rumors also circulated that the project had been scrapped in favor of a browser-based solution.[33] On August 26, 2010 Gmail accounts with Google Voice were given a function to make and receive calls. Google Voice product manager, Vincent Paquet, confirmed that this function was added through the help of the technology received after the Gizmo5 acquisition.[34] In 2011, the Gizmo5 site closed service to its registered members. As of January 2012, the website is no longer available.On June 22, 2010 Google Voice dropped the requirement for invitations to become a subscriber, and the service became available to anyone in the US with a Google account.[35]On July 27, 2009, Apple Inc. rejected a Google Voice app that had been submitted by Google six weeks earlier. Other apps created for use with Google Voice, such as GVdialer, GV Mobile and VoiceCentral, were removed from the App Store. Apple states that the reason for the rejection and removals is that these apps replaced certain iPhone functions and features.A Google spokesman released this statement on the matter:[36]We work hard to bring Google applications to a number of mobile platforms, including the iPhone. Apple Inc. did not approve the Google Voice application we submitted six weeks ago to the Apple App Store. We will continue to work to bring our services to iPhone users â for example, by taking advantage of advances in mobile browsers.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has opened an inquiry regarding the rejection of Google Voice for the iPhone. \"The FCC asked why Apple rejected the Google Voice application for the iPhone and removed related 'third-party applications' from its store.\" The FCC has also requested Google to submit a letter describing the application of Google Voice. \"The request is part of a broader-ranging inquiry by the commission on exclusive deals between cell phone carriers and handset manufacturers for hot phones.\"[37]In their response to the FCC, Google stated that the Google Voice application uses the carrier's voice network to place phone calls,[38] dispelling misconceptions that it is a Voice over Internet Protocol application. AT&T stated that they had no role in approval or rejection of the Google Voice application.[39] Apple stated that they had not rejected the application but were continuing to examine it.[40] One argument against allowing the Google Voice app on the iPhone is that they are concerned that it replaces the iPhone user interface with its own; however many dialers and messaging apps are available from the app store.[41]As a result of rejection from the Apple Store, Google released its Google Voice iPhone application as a web app in January 2010, and certain apps like GV Mobile are available through Cydia on jailbroken iPhones.[42][43]In September 2010, Sean Kovacs, creator of the app GV Mobile +, announced on his Twitter that Apple had re-accepted the application, and it has since been available for purchase on the Apple App Store. This is the second Google Voice service app available in the Apple's official application store for a year and a half, released just a day after \"GV Connect\" had been available.[44][45]In November 2010, the official Google Voice iPhone application became available in the App Store in the United States, but was still not available in other countries.[46]In September 2014, certain Google Voice features were integrated into the Google Hangouts application, an instant messaging client, which is a replacement for Google Talk.[47]In January 2017, Google made the first significant updates to Google Voice in approximately five years for Android, iOS, and the Web.[48] The user interface was overhauled with Material Design. Group and photo MMS became natively supported in Voice, not depending on Hangouts integration. Voicemail transcription for Spanish was introduced, and Google promised to provide new updates and features.On July 25, 2018, Google announced the launch of a beta version of Google Voice for business customers at their Cloud NEXT even in San Francisco, California. [49]On April 10, 2019, Google announced the general availability release for Google Voice for existing G Suite customers in select countries. [50]Features of Google Voice, many retained from GrandCentral, include:While many customers in countries beside the United States have been grandfathered into Google Voice services, the features are reduced and customers are often charged for calls to their own countries. Currently Google Voice PC-to-phone calling works only for calls into the United States and Canada or for domestic or international calls from the United States and Canada; Google plans to implement this for other countries, but a time frame has not been released. A U.S. telephone number is required to obtain a Google Voice phone number for redirecting incoming calls.[56]As a call forwarding service, Google Voice also forwards the caller line identification (CLID or caller ID) of incoming calls to the user's telephone service. A user can choose whether to display a caller's CLID, or their Google Voice number, when receiving calls via the service.Google Voice uses the caller's Google Voice number as the CLID on outgoing calls when the user places a call by calling the user's own Google Voice number and using the service's menu choices,[57] or when the web-based account portal is used to place a call.[58] With the introduction of the Google Voice application on iPhone, Android and BlackBerry phones, Google Voice users can directly dial from the Google Voice app with their Google Voice number as the outgoing CLID.Google Voice applications for Android and iOS can automatically place outgoing calls and texts via the user's Google Voice service.[59] They will also manage incoming texts and calls should the user desire. This allows Google Voice subscribers to send and receive free text messages on their mobile phones without paying for a texting plan or incurring service charges from their mobile provider, so long as all texts are sent and received through one's Google Voice number and not the number provided by the cell phone company.Although Google Voice's iPhone app is not available outside of the United States, several other Google Voice clients exist for users outside the USA. For example, the GrooVe IP Android client offers this.[60]Google Voice does not officially support SMS to phone numbers outside of the United States.[61] As of 1 June 2010 Google had purposely blocked international texts, with the intention of reintroducing the service once billing systems are in place.[62]When Google Voice was offered during beta testing, Gmail Labs offered an add-on so users could listen to voicemail messages in their Gmail inbox.[63] Since August 26, 2010, U.S. Gmail users may place calls to the U.S., Canada, and international destinations from within Gmail.[64] Calls to U.S. and Canadian phone numbers are free, while the cost of calls to international destinations starts at 1 cents per minute.[65] This is possible with the help of a voice and video chat plugin for web browsers to connect to cameras, microphones, and speakers installed in the computer.[66]Users can also opt to have their text messages, transcribed voicemails (including an audio attachment), and/or missed calls forwarded to their Gmail account. Forwarded text messages emails can be replied to as if they were regular emails. Contacts' SMS capable phones can also be added to the user's Gmail address book or Google Talk buddy list so that text conversations can be initiated and sustained through these interfaces.Google Voice refers to itself as an \"enhanced call management application\" and as such \"is not capable of placing or receiving emergency services calls.\"[67] Attempting to dial 911 in the U.S. indicates that the number is not valid.Google Voice supports sending text messages to phone numbers in the U.S. and Canada, but users can receive text messages from anywhere in the world.[68]Google Voice permits Voice Over IP (VoIP) as a beta from both the web and Android clients. It formerly supported XMPP signaling but no longer does.[69] However, it has been reported that at one time some users could receive calls with their Google Voice accounts via the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).[70]Hardware manufacturers such as Obihai Technology have created devices that enable the home user to use conventional wired telephone(s) to place and receive calls over their broadband connection through Google Voice, as well as other service providers.[71]Google Voice terminated support for some XMPP services in May 2014, disrupting service for 3rd party apps. Affected vendors included Talkatone, GrooveIP and Obihai.[72][73] Obihai initially recommended its users to switch to rival providers[74] but returned with official Google Voice support for its hardware analog telephone adapters on September 11, 2014.[75]Software manufacturers offer applications, such as PCPhoneSoft.com's \"GVJack\" App that converts magicJack dongles to use Google Voice.[76] The GVJackApp for magicJack and the GVMate Phone Adapter are signalling independent and continued to work (using Google Hangouts) after support for XMPP was terminated.[77]If the telephone to which a call is forwarded does not connect within 25 seconds, then calls are routed to Google Voice's voicemail.[78] Users who want calls to be picked up by their home, work, or mobile phone voicemail systems or answering machines must turn off call screening in Google Voice and make sure that their phone's voicemail systems or answering machines pick up before 25 seconds.[78]Google Voice provides no direct phone support contact number.[79] However, users can access the Google Voice Help Center[80] FAQ, and use the free Google Groups official Google Voice product forum[81] for support.Google Voice's partners that provide phone numbers, call-termination, call-routing, and other infrastructure include:In 2009, Google reserved 1 million telephone numbers with Level 3 Communications which were presumed to be for Google Voice.[82]AT&T petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)[83] to require Google (as it requires POTS providers) to allow calls to high-cost destinations, typically rural independent telephone companies with wholesale prices up to ten times above the national average. Google responded that it is not obligated to allow these calls.[84][85]Google Voice requires an existing phone number to register. Scammers wanting multiple anonymous unauthorized Google Voice numbers have tricked strangers into registering Google Voice numbers to their personal phone numbers. [86][87]"

        "name": "Waze",
        "text": "Waze (/weÉªz/; formerly FreeMap Israel) is a GPS navigation software app owned by Google. It works on smartphones and tablet computers that have GPS support. It provides turn-by-turn navigation information and user-submitted travel times and route details, while downloading location-dependent information over a mobile telephone network. Waze describes its app as a community-driven GPS navigation app, which is free to download and use.The Israeli company Waze Mobile developed the Waze software. Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar and Uri Levine founded the company. Two Israeli venture capital firms, Magma and Vertex, and an early-stage American venture capital firm, Bluerun Ventures, provided funding. Google acquired Waze Mobile in June 2013.The app generates revenue from hyperlocal advertising to an estimated 130 million monthly users.[6]In 2006, FreeMap Israel was a project founded and developed by Israeli programmer Ehud Shabtai as a community project, which aimed to create, with the crowd sourcing assistance of community users, a free digital database of the map of Israel in Hebrew, and to ensure its free content, update and distribution.[7] In 2008, Shabtai formed a company called Waze to commercialize the project.[8] The company name was changed to Waze Mobile Ltd in 2009.In 2010, the company raised $25 million in the second round of funding.[9] The company raised an additional $30 million in financing, the following year.[10] The app was updated in 2011 to display real-time, community-curated points of interest, including local events such as street fairs and protests.[11]In December 2011, Waze employed 80 people, composed of 70 at Ra'anana, Israel and 10 in Palo Alto, California.[12][13] The company also began to monetize its app in November 2012, offering resellers and advertisers a web interface to advertise based on location, where a small icon appears when a phone is at a particular location, prompting the user to engage.[14] It also offers to TV news stations a web interface to broadcast current traffic reports and alerts directly from the Waze app; the service had been used by 25 U.S. TV news stations by June 2013.[15] It has also been used in Rio de Janeiro inside Centro de OperaÃ§Ãµes Rio (Rio's Operations Center) since July 24, 2013,[16] as well as in New York and New Jersey since 2012.In 2013, the GSM Association, a trade association of mobile network operators, gave Waze the Best Overall Mobile App award at the association's Mobile World Congress exhibition.[17]Google bought Waze for $966 million in June 2013 to add social data to its mapping business. Waze's 100 employees received about $1.2 million on average, the largest payout to employees in Israeli high tech.[18]In June 2013, the United States Federal Trade Commission started considering whether Google's purchase of Waze might violate competition law[19] â Waze was one of very few competitors in the mobile mapping sector to Google's own Google Maps. The FTC decided that it would not challenge Google's acquisition of Waze.[20] The UK Office of Fair Trading and the Israel Antitrust Authority also investigated it and allowed the acquisition.[21][22][23]Waze collects map data, travel times and traffic information from users and transmits it to the Waze server, at no cost to Waze.[24] Waze users (\"Wazers\") can report accidents, traffic jams, speed and police traps, and, from the online map editor, can update roads, landmarks, house numbers, etc. Waze sends anonymous information, including users' speed and location, back to its database to improve the service as a whole.Based on the information collected, Waze is then in a position to provide routing and real-time traffic updates. Waze can also identify the cheapest fuel station near a user or along their route, provided Waze has enabled fuel prices for that country.Waze can be used anywhere in the world but requires enough initial users to create the maps and continuously update data to make it useful. Currently, only 13 countries have a full base map; the others are incompletely mapped, requiring users to record roads and edit maps.Waze offers turn-by-turn voice navigation, real-time traffic, and other location-specific alerts. Waze encourages users to report traffic or road hazards by offering points.[25]Waze supports Android and iPhone, while Symbian, BlackBerry 10 (except BlackBerry Q10),[26] Windows Phone 8[27] and Windows Mobile from version 5[28] were deprecated. In July 2013, Waze said they planned to support both iPhone and Android and would consider supporting new platforms. As older platforms (Symbian, WM, BlackBerry) do not support either a full native UI or other application programming interfaces they rely on, they claimed they could not support them anymore, although existing versions would continue to work.[29]Waze has the ability to direct users based on crowdsourced information. Waze users are able to report a multitude of traffic-related incidents from accidents to police traps. This data is used by Waze to help other users either by alerting them of the condition ahead or rerouting the user to avoid the area entirely. In addition to user input, Waze relies on information from state agencies for traffic events such as road construction. The idea behind this is that the more people that provide data the more accurate it will be.[30]In addition to using crowdsourced information for traffic alerts, Waze also allows registered users to modify the map data itself through the Waze Map Editor. Map editors are allowed to make changes to the map based on where they have driven while using Waze as well as their rank which is based on how many map edits a user has made. In June 2013, Waze introduced a global localization project that enables future road closures and real-time traffic updates during major events in a given country, for example Tour de France.[31] Google also acquired Waze in the same month. At the time of Google's acquisition, there were nearly 50 million Waze users.[32] In 2017, an option was added for motorcycle users, as well as specialized routes for people eligible to drive in carpool lanes.[33]In March 2017, Spotify announced its partnership with Waze to give an integrated experience where Wazers could play music on Spotify directly from Waze app and get Waze directions on Spotify app on the Android platform. Six months later, the feature was made available on the iOS platform.[34][35] In May 2017, Waze introduced the ability for users to record their own voice navigation prompts.[36]In August 2018, Waze introduced Android Auto support.[37] In September 2018, Waze introduced Apple CarPlay support after Apple released iOS 12.[38]In October 2018, Waze announced its partnership with Pandora, Deezer, iHeart Radio, NPR One, Scribd, Stitcher, and TuneIn for Waze Audio Player which Spotify has been Waze inaugural partner. However, Android users won't be able to link Deezer, and iOS users won't have access to Pandora, NPR, or TuneIn when Waze announced its partnership in Medium suggesting joining its beta program to be able to use mentioned services.[39]In February 2019, Waze updated its iOS platform with Siri Shortcuts support.[40] In May 2019 the company announced it would be adding Pandora a new streaming service to the audio play feature for iOS users, allowing riders to have more music options during their commute.[41] In August 2019, Waze add YouTube Music integration to both platform. [42]Google announced at the Google I/O 2019 developer conference it was adding Google Assistant integration with Waze.[43] The integration was made available to Android phones in June 2019.[44]Waze launched the Connected Citizens Program (CCP) in June 2014, a free, two-way data sharing program used by over 450 governments, departments of transportation, and municipalities for traffic analysis, road planning, and emergency workforce dispatching.[45][46] The program is a two-way data exchange between Waze and the partner.In 2014, Rio de Janeiro started collecting data for its traffic management system. Rio collects real-time data both from drivers who use the Waze navigation app and pedestrians who use the public-transportation app Moovit. Rio was also talking to the owners of cycling app Strava to monitor movements of cyclists. It was noted that though initially the data the apps were sharing was all anonymous, more specific identifying details were possible, if people agreed to being monitored through their smartphones if they saw benefits for them.[47]Concerns have been expressed that the app located on smartphones can be used to monitor movements by identifiable individuals.[47]Some road-safety advocates have voiced concern over the prospect of more drivers using Waze, which they say has the potential to distract them with a flurry of icons and notifications and put them at greater risk of an accident.[48]In March 2014, a successful attempt was made by students from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to fake a traffic jam.[49]In December 2014, in a letter sent to Google, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck complained about the police locator feature, claiming it could be \"misused by those with criminal intent to endanger police officers and the community\". It was alleged that Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who shot and killed two NYPD officers that month, had used the Waze app prior to the murders and had posted a screenshot from the app on his Instagram account hours before the shootings, but that was unsubstantiated as the post was made 3 weeks prior to the shootings.[50] Users are able to mark the presence of an officer with a small icon and indicate if the officer is visible or hidden. The LAPD, among other police agencies, pressured Google to disable the feature on the application. Google states that knowing the whereabouts of an officer promotes safer driving.[51][52]In April 2018, Waze was criticized for rerouting traffic to Baxter Street in Echo Park, Los Angeles, which is one of the steepest hills in the United States. The app was blamed for exacerbating the road's present condition and increasing the number of crashes and spin-outs at the steep hill. The LA municipality later reconfigured the road to a one-way street.[53][54]Waze Mobile Ltd holds several patents.[55][56][57] The Waze v2.x software was distributed under GNU General Public License v2, which did not extend to map data.[58] The base map data initially came from US Census Bureau TIGER data. FreeMap[59] data was not published under open content licenses even before the shift to Waze project. Ehud Shabtai who initiated and developed Freemap and Waze continuously insisted to crowdsource data without using external sources or projects like OpenStreetMap that would restrict commercialization of the Waze map data.[60] Starting with Waze v3 the application was rewritten and as such switched to a proprietary license.[61] The last open-source client version for the iPhone and Android is 2.4.0.0, and for Windows Mobile 2.0.[62][63]A class action suit was filed in March 2014 by accountant Roey Gorodish against Waze, claiming intellectual property violation for the use of open-source FreeMap map and code from the open-source RoadMap software,[64] a project that Ehud Shabtai had contributed for the Windows PocketPC version in 2006.[65][66][67] The lawsuit was dismissed on March 5, 2017 with a clear cut decision that there was no basis for a class action suit in this case. The lawsuit was dismissed again with final verdict given by the Israeli Supreme Court on 28 January 2019.[68]"

        "name": "Wear OS by Google",
        "text": "Wear OS (also known as Wear OS by Google, and previously known as Android Wear) is a version of Google's Android operating system designed for smartwatches and other wearables.[7][8][9] By pairing with mobile phones running Android version 4.4 or newer, or iOS version 9.3 or newer with limited support from Google's pairing application,[10] Wear OS integrates Google Assistant[11] technology and mobile notifications into a smartwatch form factor.Wear OS supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,[12] 3G, and LTE connectivity, as well as a range of features and applications. Watch face styles include round, square and rectangular. Released devices include Motorola Moto 360,[13] the LG G Watch,[14] and the Samsung Gear Live.[15] Hardware manufacturing partners include Asus, Broadcom, Fossil, HTC, Intel, LG, MediaTek, Imagination Technologies, Motorola, New Balance, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei, Skagen, Polar, TAG Heuer and Mobvoi.[16]In the first six months of availability, Canalys estimates that over 720,000 Android Wear smartwatches were shipped.[17] As of 15 March 2018, Wear OS had between 10 and 50 million application installations.[18] Wear OS was estimated to account for 10% of the smart watch market in 2015.[19]The platform was announced on March 18, 2014, along with the release of a developer preview. At the same time, companies such as Motorola, Samsung, LG, HTC and Asus were announced as partners.[20] On June 25, 2014, at Google I/O, the Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch were launched, along with further details about Android Wear. The LG G Watch is the first Android Wear smartwatch to be released and shipped. Motorola's Moto 360 was released on September 5, 2014.On December 10, 2014, an update started to roll out, adding new features including a watch face API and changed the software to be based on Android 5.0 \"Lollipop\".[21]The LG G Watch and Gear Live started shipping in July 2014, while the Moto 360 began shipping in September 2014. The next batch of Android Wear devices, which arrived at the end of 2014, included the Asus ZenWatch,[22] the Sony SmartWatch 3,[23] and the LG G Watch R.[24] As of March 2015, the latest Wear OS devices are the LG Watch Urbane,[25] and the Huawei Watch.[26]On August 31, 2015, Google launched pairing application for iOS version 8.2 or newer, allowing limited support for receiving iOS notifications on smartwatches running Wear OS.[27] As of September 2015, only the LG Watch Urbane and Huawei Watch are supported, but Google announced support for more smartwatch models.[10][28]Options include a screen always on feature and a \"tilt to wake screen\" setting,[29] to light the screen automatically.[30]Users can find directions by voice from the phone, choose transport mode, including bike, and start a journey. While traveling, the watch shows directions, and vibrates to indicate turns by feel.[31]Via Google Fit and similar applications, Wear OS supports ride and run tracking (\"OK Google, start a run\"). On devices sporting the needed sensor, heart activity can be sampled automatically through the day or on demand (\"OK Google, what's my heart rate\"). Step-counting, calorie expenditure etc. are also monitored. These features work within the Fit ecosystem, allowing integration with companion devices and applications. The watch reinforces achievements with cards noting goal attainment, when a goal is near, summaries of heart, and body activity.[32]Users can use their Wear OS watch to control their phone. Music can be requested (for instance, \"OK Google, play Deep Purple\"). The screen then shows a card for play-control, volume, skip, media images, allowing music to be controlled from the wrist with the user free to move.[31]Starting with version 2.16 users can swipe right to bring up an Assistant page with useful information similar to the Android Assistant on phones, or swipe left to display Google Fit information. This replaces the old functionality of swiping left or right to change the watch face.[33]The vibration engine alerts users about important notifications originating from a user-selectable set of applications. Wear OS provides multiple options for replying, including Google Voice Typing for dictating responses to messages, and spoken or drawn emoticons.Intelligent notifications from Google Now are supported including traffic, flights, hotel check-in, meeting alerts, location- and time-based reminders, weather and sport, stocks, flight status, boarding passes, restaurant bookings, etc.[31]Users can receive messages sent to them via Google Hangouts, and respond with a voice message.[34] Users can also set the alarm by using 'Okay Google' on Wear OS. Currently new SMS can be initiated from the watch. Wear OS 5.1.1 supports drawing to reply, which uses AI to interpret the user's sketch as an emoji character. Search by voice is fully supported. Google Now searches such as \"How tall is Nicole Kidman\" result in Knowledge Graph cards appearing on screen, with options to open the search result on another device.[21]If the phone's camera app is activated, the screen is relayed to the watch, and the user can control the shutter, and view photos on the watch. Third-party applications support using the phone camera as a streaming device, or more varied camera control.Events appear as cards on screen. \"OK Google, show my agenda\" will display the user's agenda. Watch faces also support marking out appointments (for instance with contrasting color to show periods with an appointment, and/or illuminating a lighted \"count-down\" line for upcoming appointments.[31]Note taking is fully supported via Google Keep and other note-apps, as is marking-off check lists etc. Via voice commands such as \"OK Google, remind me to call Roy at work\", or \"Remind me to baste the chicken in 25 minutes\" the user can create location and time-based reminders, set alarms, timers etc. which appear on the watch at the appropriate time or place.[9]Many applications have been released, with developers such as Evernote etc. creating new functionality on the watch: for instance, handing off notes to the watch screen when the user turns off their phone screen. Location-based applications like Foursquare show suitable nearby venues, allow check-in etc.[45]Notes only specific to Android 9.0 Pie:Android 9.0 Pie referred to as System version H"

        "name": "YouTube",
        "text": "YouTube is an American video-sharing platform headquartered in San Bruno, California. Three former PayPal employeesâChad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karimâcreated the service in February 2005. Google bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion; YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries.YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to playlists, report, comment on videos, and subscribe to other users. It offers a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos. Most content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including CBS, the BBC, Vevo, and Hulu offer some of their material via YouTube as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can only watch videos on the site, while registered users are permitted to upload an unlimited number of videos and add comments to videos. Videos deemed potentially inappropriate are available only to registered users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old.YouTube and selected creators earn advertising revenue from Google AdSense, a program which targets ads according to site content and audience. The vast majority of its videos are free to view, but there are exceptions, including subscription-based premium channels, film rentals, as well as YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, subscription services respectively offering premium and ad-free music streaming, and ad-free access to all content, including exclusive content commissioned from notable personalities. As of February 2017, there were more than 400 hours of content uploaded to YouTube each minute, and one billion hours of content being watched on YouTube every day. As of August 2018, the website is ranked as the second-most popular site in the world, according to Alexa Internet, just behind Google.[1] As of May 2019, more than 500 hours of video content are uploaded to YouTube every minute.[6]YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations, including its handling of copyrighted content contained within uploaded videos,[7] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods,[8] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent and/or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters,[9] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections,[10] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising.[7]YouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, who were all early employees of PayPal.[11] Hurley had studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois at UrbanaâChampaign.[12]Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson's role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident, when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online, which led to the idea of a video sharing site.[13] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service, and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[14][15] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any type of video.[16]According to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[14]YouTube began as a venture capitalâfunded technology startup, primarily from an $11.5 million investment by Sequoia Capital and an $8 million investment from Artis Capital Management between November 2005 and April 2006.[17][18] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[19] The domain name www.youtube.com was activated on February 14, 2005, and the website was developed over the subsequent months.[20] The first YouTube video, titled Me at the zoo, shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo.[21] The video was uploaded on April 23, 2005, and can still be viewed on the site.[22] YouTube offered the public a beta test of the site in May 2005. The first video to reach one million views was a Nike advertisement featuring Ronaldinho in November 2005.[23][24] Following a $3.5 million investment from Sequoia Capital in November, the site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[25][26]At the time of the official launch, YouTube did not have much market recognition. The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's Saturday Night Live ran a skit \"Lazy Sunday\" by The Lonely Island. Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views before they were removed at request of NBC-Universal about two months later, but even their short presence at the site not only helped spread the name of YouTube, but allowed users to see it was not just for video lovers and people who create their own video content, but a means to share other types of videos, such as television clips and music videos.[27][28] The site grew rapidly and, in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day, and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[29] According to data published by market research company comScore, YouTube is the dominant provider of online video in the United States, with a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos in May 2010.[30]In May 2011, 48 hours of new videos were uploaded to the site every minute,[31] which increased to 60 hours every minute in January 2012,[31] 100 hours every minute in May 2013,[32][33] 300 hours every minute in November 2014,[34] and 400 hours every minute in February 2017.[35] As of January 2012, the site had 800 million unique users a month.[36] It is has been claimed, by The Daily Telegraph in 2008, that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[37] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, YouTube is the second-most visited website in the world, as of December 2016; SimilarWeb also lists YouTube as the top TV and video website globally, attracting more than 15 billion visitors per month.[1][38][39] In October 2006, YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California.[40]The choice of the name www.youtube.com led to problems for a similarly named website, www.utube.com. The site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube has since changed the name of its website to www.utubeonline.com.[41][42]On October 9, 2006, Google Inc. announced that it had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[43][44] and the deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[45][46]In March 2010, YouTube began free streaming of certain content, including 60 cricket matches of the Indian Premier League. According to YouTube, this was the first worldwide free online broadcast of a major sporting event.[47] On March 31, 2010, the YouTube website launched a new design, with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site. Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented: \"We really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter.\"[48] In May 2010, YouTube videos were watched more than two billion times per day.[49][50][51] This increased to three billion in May 2011,[52][53][54] and four billion in January 2012.[31][55] In February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube was watched every day.[56][57][58]In October 2010, Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role, and that Salar Kamangar would take over as head of the company.[59] In April 2011, James Zern, a YouTube software engineer, revealed that 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[60] In November 2011, the Google+ social networking site was integrated directly with YouTube and the Chrome web browser, allowing YouTube videos to be viewed from within the Google+ interface.[61]In December 2011, YouTube launched a new version of the site interface, with the video channels displayed in a central column on the home page, similar to the news feeds of social networking sites.[62] At the same time, a new version of the YouTube logo was introduced with a darker shade of red, the first change in design since October 2006.[63]In early March 2013, YouTube finalized the transition for all channels to the previously[when?] optional âOne Channel Layoutâ, which removed many customization options and custom background images for consistency, and split up the channel information to different tabs (Home/Feed, Videos Playlists, Discussion, About) rather than one unified page.[64]In May 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels within the platform.[65][66] In February 2014, Susan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube.[67] In November 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as \"Music Key\", which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[68]In February 2015, YouTube released a secondary mobile app known as YouTube Kids. The app is designed to provide an experience optimized for children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control features.[69] Later on August 26, 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gamingâa video gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[70]In October 2015, YouTube announced YouTube Red (now YouTube Premium), a new premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year), premium original series and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[71][72][73]In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million. The complex has 554,000 square feet of space and can house up to 2,800 employees.[74]On August 29, 2017, YouTube officially launched the âpolymerâ redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem.[75]On April 3, 2018, a shooting took place at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California.[76]On May 17, 2018, YouTube announced the re-branding of YouTube Red as YouTube Premium (accompanied by a major expansion of the service into Canada and 13 European markets), as well as the upcoming launch of a separate YouTube Music subscription.[77]In September 2018, YouTube began to phase out the separate YouTube Gaming website and app, and introduced a new Gaming portal within the main service. YouTube staff argued that the separate platform was causing confusion, and that the integration would allow the features developed for the service (including game-based portals and enhanced discoverability of gaming-related videos and live streaming) to reach a broader audience through the main YouTube website.[78]In July 2019, It was announced that YouTube will discontinue support for Nintendo 3DS systems on September 3, 2019. However, owners of New Nintendo 3DS, or New Nintendo 3DS XL, can still access YouTube on the Internet browser.[79]YouTube primarily uses the VP9 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video formats, and the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP protocol.[citation needed] YouTube has begun rolling out videos in AV1 format.[80]Previously, viewing YouTube videos on a personal computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in the browser.[81] In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard.[82] This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed.[83][84] The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial. Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the MP4 (with H.264 video) or WebM (with VP8 video) formats could play the videos, and not all videos on the site were available.[85][86]On January 27, 2015, YouTube announced that HTML5 would be the default playback method on supported browsers. YouTube used to employ Adobe Dynamic Streaming for Flash,[87] but with the switch to HTML5 video now streams video using Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), an adaptive bit-rate HTTP-based streaming solution optimizing the bitrate and quality for the available network.[88]All YouTube users can upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users who have a good track record of complying with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone.[89][90] When YouTube was launched in 2005, it was possible to upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films.[91] The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010.[92] In the past, it was possible to upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos can be at most 128 GB in size.[89] Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.[93]YouTube accepts videos that are uploaded in most container formats, including AVI, MP4, MPEG-PS, QuickTime File Format and FLV. It supports WebM files and also 3GP, allowing videos to be uploaded from mobile phones.[94]Videos with progressive scanning or interlaced scanning can be uploaded, but for the best video quality, YouTube suggests interlaced videos be deinterlaced before uploading. All the video formats on YouTube use progressive scanning.[95] YouTube's statistics shows that interlaced videos are still being uploaded to YouTube, and there is no sign of that actually dwindling. YouTube attributes this to uploading of made-for-TV content.[96]YouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320Ã240 pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263),[97][98] with mono MP3 audio.[99] In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP format on mobile phones.[100] In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480Ã360 pixels.[101] In December 2008, 720p HD support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a widescreen 16:9.[102] With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default video compression format. In November 2009, 1080p HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096Ã3072 pixels.[103][104] In March 2015, support for 4K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 3840âÃâ2160 pixels. In June 2015, support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680Ã4320 pixels.[105] In November 2016, support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) or Perceptual Quantizer (PQ).[106] HDR video can be encoded with the Rec. 2020 color space.[107]In June 2014, YouTube began to deploy support for high frame rate videos up to 60 frames per second (as opposed to 30 before), becoming available for user uploads in October. YouTube stated that this would enhance \"motion-intensive\" videos, such as video game footage.[108][109][110][111]YouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ), and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the VP9 format with stereo Opus audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports Windows XP, then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead.[112]From 2008 to 2017, users could add \"annotations\" to their videosâsuch as pop-up text messages and hyperlinks. These functions were notably used as the basis for interactive videos, which used hyperlinks to other videos to achieve branching elements. In March 2017, it was announced that the annotations editor had been discontinued and the feature would be sunset, because their use had fallen rapidly, users had found them to be an annoyance, and because they were incompatible with mobile versions of the service. Annotations were removed entirely from all videos on January 15, 2019. YouTube had introduced standardized widgets intended to replace annotations in a cross-platform manner, including \"end screens\" (a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video) and \"cards\", but they are not backwards compatible with existing annotations, while the removal of annotations will also break all interactive experiences which depended on them.[113][114][115][116]YouTube carried out early experiments with live streaming, including a concert by U2 in 2009, and a question-and-answer session with US President Barack Obama in February 2010.[117] These tests had relied on technology from 3rd-party partners, but in September 2010, YouTube began testing its own live streaming infrastructure.[118] In April 2011, YouTube announced the rollout of YouTube Live, with a portal page at the URL \"www.youtube.com/live\". The creation of live streams was initially limited to select partners.[119] It was used for real-time broadcasting of events such as the 2012 Olympics in London.[120] In October 2012, more than 8 million people watched Felix Baumgartner's jump from the edge of space as a live stream on YouTube.[121]In May 2013, creation of live streams was opened to verified users with at least 1,000 subscribers; in August of that year the number was reduced to 100 subscribers,[122] and in December the limit was removed.[123] In February 2017, live streaming was introduced to the official YouTube mobile app. Live streaming via mobile was initially restricted to users with at least 10,000 subscribers,[124] but as of mid-2017 it has been reduced to 100 subscribers.[125] Live streams can be up to 4K resolution at 60 fps, and also support 360Â° video.[126] In February 2017, a live streaming feature called Super Chat was introduced, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment highlighted.[127]In a video posted on July 21, 2009,[128] YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users could now upload 3D videos. The videos can be viewed in several different ways, including the common anaglyph (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect.[129][130][131] The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, side-by-side or anaglyph using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision.[132] The feature set has since been reduced, and the 3D feature currently only supports red/cyan anaglyph with no side-by-side support.In January 2015, Google announced that 360-degree video would be natively supported on YouTube. On March 13, 2015, YouTube enabled 360Â° videos which can be viewed from Google Cardboard, a virtual reality system. YouTube 360 can also be viewed from all other virtual reality headsets.[133] Live streaming of 360Â° video at up to 4K resolution is also supported.[126]In 2017, YouTube began to promote an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR180, which is limited to a 180-degree field of view, but is promoted as being easier to produce than 360-degree video, and allowing more depth to be maintained by not subjecting the video to equirectangular projection.[134]In late November 2018, YouTube announced that it would introduce a \"Story\" feature, similar to ones used by Snapchat and Instagram, which would allow its content creators to engage fans without posting a full video.[135] The stories, called \"Reels,\" would be up to 30 seconds in length and would allow users to add \"filters, music, text and more, including new \"YouTube-y\" stickers.\" Unlike those of other platforms, YouTube's stories could be made multiple times and would not expire. Instead of being placed at the top of the user interface as is commonly done, the \"Reels\" option would be featured as a separate tab on the creator's channel.[136] As of its announcement, only certain content creators would have access to the \"Reels\" option, which would be utilized as a beta-version for further feedback and testing. If users engage more with the \"Reels\" option, it may end up as a more permanent feature and \"trigger their appearance on the viewer's YouTube home page as recommendations.\" As of November 28, 2018, YouTube did not specify when \"Reels\" would arrive in Beta or when it would be publicly released.[135]On September 13, 2016, YouTube launched a public beta of Community, a social media-based feature that allows users to post text, images (including GIFs), live videos and others in a separate \"Community\" tab on their channel.[137] Prior to the release, several creators had been consulted to suggest tools Community could incorporate that they would find useful; these YouTubers included Vlogbrothers, AsapScience, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3.[138]After the feature has been officially released, the community post feature gets activated automatically for every channel that passes a specific threshold of subscriber counts or already has more subscribers. This threshold was lowered over time[when?], from 10000 subscribers to 1500 subscribers, to 1000 subscribers, which is the current threshold as of September 2019.[139]Channels that the community tab becomes enabled for, get their channel discussions (name prior to March 2013 âOne channel layoutâ redesign finalization: âchannel commentsâ) permanently erased, instead of co-existing or migrating.[140]YouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of HTML that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.[141] This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by or related to another user's video are able to make a \"video response\". On August 27, 2013, YouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature.[142] Embedding, rating, commenting and response posting can be disabled by the video owner.[143]YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface.[144] A small number of videos, can be downloaded as MP4 files.[145] Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos.[146] In February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout.[147] In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos.[148] In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.[149]Users retain copyright of their own work under the default Standard YouTube License,[150] but have the option to grant certain usage rights under any public copyright license they choose. Since July 2012, it has been possible to select a Creative Commons attribution license as the default, allowing other users to reuse and remix the material.[151]Most modern smartphones are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video.[152] Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.[153] Since June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone.[154] In July 2010, the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls.[155] The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform.[156][157] In September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system.[158] According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.[159]A TiVo service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.[160] In January 2009, YouTube launched \"YouTube for TV\", a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the PlayStation 3 and Wii video game consoles.[161][162] In June 2009, YouTube XL was introduced, which has a simplified interface designed for viewing on a standard television screen.[163] YouTube is also available as an app on Xbox Live.[164] On November 15, 2012, Google launched an official app for the Wii, allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel.[165] An app is also available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, and videos can be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5.[166] Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17, 2013,[167] and, in October 2014, the Sony PlayStation 4.[168] In November 2018, YouTube launched as a downloadable app for the Nintendo Switch.[169]On June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt traveled to Paris to launch the new localization system.[170] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 102 countries, one territory (Hong Kong) and a worldwide version.[171]The YouTube interface suggests which local version should be chosen on the basis of the IP address of the user. In some cases, the message \"This video is not available in your country\" may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.[219] The interface of the YouTube website is available in 76 language versions, including Amharic, Albanian, Armenian, Bengali, Burmese, Khmer, Kyrgyz, Laotian, Mongolian, Persian and Uzbek, which do not have local channel versions. Access to YouTube was blocked in Turkey between 2008 and 2010, following controversy over the posting of videos deemed insulting to Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk and some material offensive to Muslims.[220][221] In October 2012, a local version of YouTube was launched in Turkey, with the domain youtube.com.tr. The local version is subject to the content regulations found in Turkish law.[222] In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British royalty collection agency PRS for Music led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009.[223] In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.[224]YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers advertising-free streaming, access to exclusive content, background and offline video playback on mobile devices, and access to the Google Play Music \"All Access\" service.[225] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music \"All Access\" service.[226][227][228] On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos, as well as access to exclusive original content.[229][230][231] As of November 2016, the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[232] As of June 2017, the first season of YouTube Red Originals had gotten 250 million views in total.[233]In May 2014, before Music Key service was launched, the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were \"undervalued\" in comparison to other streaming services, and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service. In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014, Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service \"to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms.\" Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that \"while we wish that we had [a] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience.\"[234][235][236][237] The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Networkâa trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service. However, YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal.[228]On September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[238]On February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced the launch of YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$35 per month. Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[239][240] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC), as well as approximately 40 cable channels owned by the corporate parents of those networks, The Walt Disney Company, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal and Turner Broadcasting System (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN). Subscribers can also receive Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content (YouTube TV does not include a YouTube Red subscription).[241][242]During the 2017 World Series (in which it was the presenting sponsor), YouTube TV ads were placed behind the home plate. The trademarked red play button logo appeared at the center of the screen, mimicking YouTube's interface.[243]YouTube Go is an Android app aimed at making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets. It is distinct from the company's main Android app and allows videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allows users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offers more options for mobile data control and video resolution.[244]YouTube announced the project in September 2016 at an event in India.[245] It was launched in India in February 2017, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa.[246][247] It was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq on February 1, 2018. The app is available to around 60% of the world's population.[248][249]In early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music.[250] On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named \"YouTube Music\" was launched.[251][252]In 2018, YouTube became an ISNI registry, and announced its intention to begin creating ISNI identifiers to uniquely identify the musicians whose videos it features.[253] ISNI anticipate the number of ISNI IDs \"going up by perhaps 3-5 million over the next couple of years\" as a result.[254]YouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\".[255][256] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\".[257] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\"[258]The next year, the site celebrated its \"100th anniversary\" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900s-style films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat.[259] In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD.[260]In 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company The Onion to claim in an uploaded video that the video sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[261][262]In 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as \"Clocking\", \"Kissing Dad\", and \"Glub Glub Water Dance\".[263] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from \"Sandstorm\" by Darude.[264] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[265]In 2016, YouTube introduced a global program to develop creators whose videos produce a positive social impact. Google dedicated $1 million to this Creators for Change program.[266] The first three videos from the program premiered at the 2017 Tribeca TV Festival.[267] YouTube expanded the program in 2018.[268]Both private individuals[269] and large production companies[270] have used YouTube to grow audiences. Independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[269] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings, and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television.[270] While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producerâits top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[271] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million[272]âin 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music labels\".[273] In 2013 Forbes' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[274] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year.[275] By early 2013 Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts.[276]Observing that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been \"fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution\", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and asserted that \"what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication\".[277] Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch \"the biggest learning cycle in human history.\"[277] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what Forbes'  Michael Noer called \"the largest school in the world\", with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[278] YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[279] the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that \"both embodies and promotes democracy.\"[280] The Washington Post reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white.[281] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of \"visual journalism\", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.[282] The study also concluded that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people acquire news.[283]YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political landscape.[284] Describing the Arab Spring (2010â ), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using \"Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world.\"[285] In 2012, more than a third of the U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the \"Kony 2012\" video was posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video \"will do more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined.\"[286]Conversely, YouTube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012[289] and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance.[290] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held a meeting at the White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare[291] but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the \"YouTube Generation\".[287] Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.[287]Some YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as Innocence of Muslims (2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[292] TED curator Chris Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[277] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in The New York Times that such videos have \"surprising implications\" for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music.[293]The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers[294] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[295] selected their membership based on individual video performances.[277][295] Further, the cybercollaboration charity video \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)\" was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[296] with The Tokyo Times noting the \"We Pray for You\" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes.[297] The anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[298] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet secretaries.[299] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video \"My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm\", legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[300] In May 2018, London Metropolitan Police claimed that the drill videos that talk about violence give rise to the gang-related violence. YouTube deleted 30 music videos after the complaint.[301]Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing.[302] In June 2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[303] In January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television.[36] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion.[304] In 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to eMarketer,[304][305][306] while others estimated $4.7 billion.[304] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising.[65] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[307] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix and Hulu.[65] In 2017, viewers on average watch YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.[308]YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[309] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[310] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[311][312] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[313] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[314] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010.[315][316] The service offers over 6,000 films.[317]In May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site.[318] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader.[319][320]There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program.[321] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[322]YouTube policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with advertising, including videos containing strong violence, language, sexual content, \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\" (unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\"),[323] and videos whose user comments contain \"inappropriate\" content.[324]In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos.[325][326] In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription.[327] On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watchtime within the past 12 months and 1,000 subscribers.[327] The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.[328]YouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.[329] The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal and ruby are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million and fifty million subscribers, respectively.[330][331]Much of YouTube's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos.[306] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders. YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue.[332] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[333] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators.[334][335][336]YouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site's features. Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content, videos of animal abuse, shock videos, content uploaded without the copyright holder's consent, hate speech, spam, and predatory behavior.[337] Despite the guidelines, YouTube has faced criticism from news sources for content in violation of these guidelines.At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws.[338] Despite this advice, there are still many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted.[339][340] Organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[341][342][343] Viacom, demanding $1 billion in damages, said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed \"an astounding 1.5 billion times\". YouTube responded by stating that it \"goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works\".[344]During the same court battle, Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site. The decision was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which called the court ruling \"a setback to privacy rights\".[345][346] In June 2010, Viacom's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a summary judgment, with U.S. federal Judge Louis L. Stanton stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling.[347] On April 5, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reinstated the case, allowing Viacom's lawsuit against Google to be heard in court again.[348] On March 18, 2014, the lawsuit was settled after seven years with an undisclosed agreement.[349]In August 2008, a US court ruled in Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz from Gallitzin, Pennsylvania, who had made a home video of her 13-month-old son dancing to Prince's song \"Let's Go Crazy\", and posted the 29-second video on YouTube.[350] In the case of Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[351] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were ruled in Smith's favor.[352]In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users. The performance rights organization GEMA argued that YouTube had not done enough to prevent the uploading of German copyrighted music. YouTube responded by stating:We remain committed to finding a solution to the music licensing issue in Germany that will benefit artists, composers, authors, publishers and record labels, as well as the wider YouTube community.[353]On November 1, 2016, the dispute with GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos with content protected by GEMA.[354]In April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice. When a dispute occurs, the uploader of the video has to contact UMG.[355][356] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.[357]In June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.[358] The system, which was initially called \"Video Identification\"[359][360] and later became known as Content ID,[361] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[362] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video. By 2010, YouTube had \"already invested tens of millions of dollars in this technology\".[360] In 2011, YouTube described Content ID as \"very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File\".[362] By 2012, Content ID accounted for over a third of the monetized views on YouTube.[363]An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube, and concluded that while the system was \"surprisingly resilient\" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.[364] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[365] If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[366] Prior to 2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute.[367] Should the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the \"Video Manager\".[368] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[369]YouTube has also faced criticism over the handling of offensive content in some of its videos. The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube's \"Community Guidelines\".[337] YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's guidelines.[337]Controversial content has included material relating to Holocaust denial and the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.[370][371] In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom stated that it was \"unimpressed\" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that \"proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content\". YouTube responded by stating:We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly.[372] (July 2008)In October 2010, U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner urged YouTube to remove from its website videos of imam Anwar al-Awlaki.[373] YouTube pulled some of the videos in November 2010, stating they violated the site's guidelines.[374] In December 2010, YouTube added the ability to flag videos for containing terrorism content.[375]Following media reports about PRISM, NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including YouTube. According to leaks from the program, YouTube joined the PRISM program in 2010.[376]YouTube's policies on \"advertiser-friendly content\" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being monetized; this includes strong violence, language, sexual content, and \"controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown\", unless the content is \"usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain\".[377] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent users, including Phillip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn advertising revenue on such videos was \"censorship by a different name\". A YouTube spokesperson stated that while the policy itself was not new, the service had \"improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators\".[378][379][380]In March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered in a safe and appropriate way\". The Guardian newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\".[381][382] In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had actually been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[383][384]On April 6, 2017, YouTube announced that in order to \"ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules\", it would change its practices to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000 lifetime views, before they may join the Partner Program.[385]In January 2018, YouTube creator Logan Paul faced criticism for a video he had uploaded from a trip to Japan, where he encountered a body of a suicide death in the Aokigahara forest. The corpse was visible in the video, although its face was censored. The video proved controversial due to its content, with its handling of the subject matter being deemed insensitive by critics. On January 10âeleven days after the video was publishedâYouTube announced that it would cut Paul from the Google Preferred advertising program. Six days later, YouTube announced tighter thresholds for the partner program to \"significantly improve our ability to identify creators who contribute positively to the community\", under which channels must have at least 4,000 hours of watch time within the past 12 months and at least 1,000 subscribers. YouTube also announced that videos approved for the Google Preferred program would become subject to manual review, and that videos would be rated based on suitability (with advertisers allowed to choose).[386][387][388]These changes led to further criticism of YouTube from independent channels, who alleged that the service had been changing its algorithms to give a higher prominence to professionally-produced content (such as celebrities, music videos and clips from late night talk shows), that attract wide viewership and has a lower risk of alienating mainstream advertisers, at the expense of the creators that had bolstered the service's popularity.[389][390]YouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories, falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse.[391][392][393] According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal, \"YouTubeâs recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories, partisan viewpoints and misleading videos, even when those users havenât shown interest in such content. When users show a political bias in what they choose to view, YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.\"[391][394] When users search for political or scientific terms, YouTube's search algorithms often give prominence to hoaxes and conspiracy theories.[393][395] After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking-news queries during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources.[391][396][397][398] In 2018, it was reported that YouTube was again promoting fringe content about breaking news, giving great prominence to conspiracy videos about Anthony Bourdain's death.[399]In 2017, it was revealed that advertisements were being placed on extremist videos, including videos by rape apologists, anti-Semites and hate preachers who received ad payouts.[400] After firms started to stop advertising on YouTube in the wake of this reporting, YouTube apologized and said that it would give firms greater control over where ads got placed.[400]Alex Jones, known for far-right conspiracy theories, had built a massive audience on YouTube.[401] YouTube drew criticism in 2018 when it removed a video from Media Matters compiling offensive statements made by Jones, stating that it violated its policies on \"harassment and bullying\".[402] On August 6, 2018, however, YouTube removed Alex Jones' YouTube page following a content violation.[403]University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has referred to YouTube as \"The Great Radicalizer\", saying \"YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\"[404] Jonathan Albright of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University described YouTube as a \"conspiracy ecosystem\".[393][405]In January 2019, YouTube said that it had introduced a new policy intended to stop recommending videos containing \"content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\" YouTube gave flat earth theories, miracle cures, and 9/11 trutherism as examples.[406] Efforts within YouTube engineering to stop recommending borderline extremist videos falling just short of forbidden hate speech, and track their popularity were originally rejected because they could interfere with viewer engagement, but began being implemented in 2019.[407]A July 2019 study found that when users searched for videos related to the climate and climate change, the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change.[408]A 2019 BBC investigation found that YouTube's algorithm promoted health misinformation, including fake cancer cures.[409] In Brazil, YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters, as well as elevated far-right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories.[410]Leading into 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children, coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family's activities, and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family-friendly material. In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90%.[411][412] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety. During Q2 2017, the owners of popular channel DaddyOFive, which featured themselves playing \"pranks\" on their children, were accused of child abuse. Their videos were eventually deleted, and two of their children were removed from their custody.[413][414][415][416] A similar case happened in 2019 when the owners of the channel Fantastic Adventures was accused of abusing her adopted children. Her videos would later be deleted.[417]Later that year, YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent, sexual or otherwise disturbing situations, many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views. The term \"Elsagate\" was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy.[418][419][420][421] On November 11, 2017, YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content. Later that month, the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family friendly characters. As part as a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube, the wave of deletions also targeted channels which showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults. Most notably, the company removed Toy Freaks, a channel with over 8.5 million subscribers, that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations.[422][422][423][424][425][426] According to analytics specialist SocialBlade, it earned up to Â£8.7 million annually prior to its deletion.[427]Even for content that appears to aimed at children and appears to contain only child-friendly content, YouTube's system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos. These questions have been raised in the past, as YouTube has had to remove channels with children's content which, after becoming popular, then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children's content. A current example is the \"Cocomelon\" YouTube channel containing numerous mass-produced animated videos aimed at children which has drawn up to US$10 million a month in ad revenue. The channel is reportedly owned by Treasure Studio, but journalists have not able to confirm any associated with the studio or channel.[428][429][430] \"Cocomelon\" and other channels like it a part of a YouTube \"hellscape\" because of the lack of knowledge of what purpose they are trying to serve.[431]In January 2019, YouTube officially banned videos containing \"challenges that encourage acts that have an inherent risk of severe physical harm\" (such as, for example, the Tide Pod Challenge), and videos featuring pranks that \"make victims believe they're in physical danger\" or cause emotional distress in children.[432]Also in November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children â often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics â were attracting comments from pedophiles[433][434] with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian.[434] Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web, and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles.[435]As a result of the controversy, which added to the concern about \"Elsagate\", several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube.[421][436] In December 2018, The Times found more than 100 grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior (such as taking off clothes, adopting sexualised poses and touching other children inappropriately) by strangers.[437] After a reporter flagged the videos in question, half of them were removed, and the rest were removed after The Times contacted YouTube's PR department.[437]In February 2019, YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a \"wormhole\" that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content, and make all of that user's recommended content feature only these types of videos. Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions, or otherwise making indecent remarks. In some cases, other users had reuploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos, and then monetized these, propagating this network.[438] In the wake of the controversy, the service reported that they had deleted over 400 channels and tens of millions of comments, and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A spokesperson explained that \"any content â including comments â that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.\"[439][440] Despite these measures, AT&T, Disney, Dr. Oetker, Epic Games, and NestlÃ© all pulled their advertising from YouTube.[438][441]Subsequently, YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments. The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem.[442] YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children, and preemptively disable their comments sections. \"Trusted partners\" can request that comments be re-enabled, but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments. These actions mainly target videos of toddlers, but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual, such as gymnastics. YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators.[443][444]A related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string \"CP\" (an abbreviation of child pornography) resulted in a number of prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation, including videos related to the mobile video game PokÃ©mon Go (which uses \"CP\" as an abbreviation of the statistic \"Combat Power\"), and Club Penguin. YouTube apologized for the errors, and reinstated the affected videos.[445] Separately, online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said; this activity became an issue during the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in early 2019. YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity.[446]In June 2019, The New York Times cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children.[447] As a result, Senator Josh Hawley stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as \"recommended\" videos, excluding those that were \"professionally produced\", such as videos of televised talent shows.[448] YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system, as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system.[449]In April 2018, a coalition of 23 groups (including the CCFC, CDD, as well as Common Sense Media) filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that YouTube collected information from users under the age of 13 without parental consent, in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).[450]In September 2019, YouTube was fined $170 million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13 (in particular, viewing history) without parental consent, in order to allow channel operators to serve targeted advertising on their videos. In particular, the FTC ruled that YouTube was partly liable under COPPA, as the service's rating and curation of content as being suitable for children constituted the targeting of the website towards children.[451] In order to comply with the settlement, YouTube was ordered to \"develop, implement, and maintain a system for Channel Owners to designate whether their Content on the YouTube Service is directed to Children.\" YouTube also announced that it would invest $100 million over the next three years to support the creation of \"thoughtful, original children's content\".[452][453]YouTube began to implement its compliance approach in November 2019, in line with its settlement with the FTC. All channels must declare if their content is \"made for kids\", either as a blanket claim for their entire channel, or on a per-video basis. The company states that a video is considered \"made for kids\" if its primary audience is children, or is \"directed\" to children based on various factors as guidelines (even if they are not the primary audience), including use of child actors, \"characters, celebrities, or toys that appeal to children\", depictions of \"activities that appeal to children, such as play-acting, simple songs or games, or early education\", and poems, songs, and stories intended for children, among others. YouTube will employ machine learning to find videos that they believe are clearly \"made for kids\" and automatically mark them as such, but will not help or advise content creators for videos that fall into unclear categories, as this constitutes legal advice.[454][455][456] In order to prevent data to be collected from minors without consent, videos marked as being \"made for kids\" will have reduced functionality beginning in January 2020. Social and community features such as end screens and other widgets, notification functions, and comments will be disabled, and videos can only be monetized with contextual advertising based on the video's metadata.[455][452][456] Further, liability for failing proper marking channels or videos as \"made for kids\" would fall onto the channel owners, with the FTC able to issue up to $42,000 fines per infringing video, though the FTC clarified that the amount would be based on \"a companyâs financial condition and the impact a penalty could have on its ability to stay in business\".[457]The new policies have faced criticism, with some channel owners having considered YouTube and the FTC's guidance to be unclear in certain edge cases, such as video gaming (where content may typically be directed towards teens and young adults, but may still contain characters that appeal to children). They also noted that according to YouTube, a lack of targeted ads can reduce a video's revenue, and that the lack of social features may impact the ability for their videos to receive promotion.[455][456] Videos marked \"made for kids\" are also excluded from Google search engine results, further lowering revenue for content creators.[457] Content creators who were unsure of whether their content was \"made for kids\" argued they would either need to preemptively mark their videos as such or take their videos private, or otherwise would be at risk of being fined by the FTC.[455][456] FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter noted in dissenting remarks that many of the child-directed channels on YouTube were run by owners outside of the U.S., which may fall outside the jurisdiction of COPPA and the FTC's \"practical reach\".[458] The FTC issued a blog post on November 22, 2019 to clarify what it considered \"made for kids\" and that several factors will be used to make this determination, and that it recognized that some types of content, like animated programming, can appeal to all ages and would not be immediately become subject to COPPA's requirements. The FTC also directed creators to its original complaint against YouTube, identifying channels and video content that they considered to be under COPPA that was the basis of their case.[459]Most videos enable users to leave comments, and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content. In 2006, Time praised Web 2.0 for enabling \"community and collaboration on a scale never seen before\", and added that YouTube \"harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred\".[460] The Guardian in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as:[461]Juvenile, aggressive, misspelled, sexist, homophobic, swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL, YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance â with the occasional burst of wit shining through.In September 2008, The Daily Telegraph commented that YouTube was \"notorious\" for \"some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet\", and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, \"a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts\".[462] The Huffington Post noted in April 2012 that finding comments on YouTube that appear \"offensive, stupid and crass\" to the \"vast majority\" of the people is hardly difficult.[463]On November 6, 2013, Google implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.[464] The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.[465][466] In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question \"why the fuck do I need a google+ account to comment on a video?\" on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change.[467] The official YouTube announcement[468] received 20,097 \"thumbs down\" votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days.[469] Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that \"Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos\" and \"Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system\". In the same article Melvin goes on to say:[470]Perhaps user complaints are justified, but the idea of revamping the old system isn't so bad.Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation. Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot? The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.On July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.[471]On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments.[472] Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam. They can also allow other users to moderate their comments.[473]In December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. This was disputed by Billboard, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.[474][475] On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video's view count to freeze at \"301\" (later \"301+\") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[476] YouTube view counts once again updated in real time.[477]However, as a monumental Easter egg, YouTube has deliberately frozen the publicly indicated view count of one video to â301 viewsâ, which is the Video by Numberphile titled âWhy do YouTube views freeze at 301?â (published in 2012), which explains this former behaviour of YouTube.[476]In 2018, YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other fake news, filling the infobox with content from Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech.[478] In the wake of the Notre-Dame de Paris fire on April 15, 2019, several user-uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube' system automatically with an Encyclopedia Britannica article on the false conspiracy theories around the September 11 attacks. Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection. YouTube officials apologized for this, stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically, and were taking steps to remedy this.[479]Five leading content creators whose channels were based on LGBTQ+ materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August 2019, alleging that YouTube's algorithms diverts discovery away from their channels, impacting their revenue. The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like \"lesbian\" or \"gay\", which would be predominant in their channels' content, and because of YouTube's near-monopolization of online video services, they are abusing that position.[480]In October 2019 YouTube deactivated two channels run by \"pick-up artists\" after a BBC investigation into the online industry. The company said: It added: \"YouTube strictly prohibits explicit sexual, graphic or harassing content. Nothing is more important than protecting the safety of our community, and we will continue to review and refine our policies in this area.\"[481]As of 2018, China and North Korea permanently block accessing YouTube, while Iran blocks YouTube on only one Internet service provider. YouTube was blocked in Uzbekistan in October 2018 for unknown reasons.[482] Access to Facebook had been blocked a month earlier. People in the country rely on virtual private network software to circumvent the blockage. On January 15, it was reported that the blockage had been repealed, but it lasted only for 6â7 hours.[483]Governments block YouTube for a variety of reasons, including:[484]In some countries, YouTube is completely blocked, either through a long term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open, but access to specific videos is blocked. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service. Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to bandwidth limitations and the site's potential for distraction.[484]Several countries have previously blocked access to YouTube:General"

        "name": "YouTube Kids",
        "text": "YouTube Kids is an American kids video website developed by YouTube. The website provides a version of the service-oriented towards children, with curated selections of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing by kids 12 and under.First released on February 23, 2015 as an Android and iOS mobile app,[2] the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as well as for Android TV.[3][4] As of September 2019, the app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province.[5] YouTube launched a web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.[6]YouTube Kids has faced criticism from advocacy groups, particularly the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, for concerns surrounding the app's use of commercial advertising, as well as algorithmic suggestions of videos that may be inappropriate for the app's target audience. The app has also been associated with a controversy surrounding disturbing and/or violent videos depicting characters from children's media franchises. Criticism over the videos led YouTube to announce that it would take more stringent actions to review and filter such videos when reported by the community, and prevent them from being accessible from within the YouTube Kids app.The app is divided into four content categories; \"Recommended\", \"Shows\", \"Music\", and \"Learning\". The categories feature curated selections of content from channels deemed appropriate for children.[7][8]In August 2016, the app was updated to support the YouTube Red (now YouTube Premium) subscription service, allowing ad-free playback, background playback, and offline playback for subscribers.[9] In February 2017, YouTube began to introduce premium original series oriented specifically towards YouTube Kids, including DanTDM Creates a Big Scene, Fruit Ninja: Frenzy Force, Hyperlinked, and Kings of Atlantis.[10] YouTube has also presented advocacy campaigns through special playlists featured on YouTube Kids, including \"#ReadAlong\" (a series of videos, primarily featuring kinetic typography) to promote literacy,[11] \"#TodayILearned\" (which featured a playlist of STEM-oriented programs and videos),[12] and \"Make it Healthy, Make it Fun\" (a collaboration with Marc and Pau Gasol to promote healthy living and an active lifestyle to children).[13]In November 2017, the app was updated to add additional user interface modes designed for different age groups, ranging from the existing simplified interface (intended for younger children), to a more dense interface designed for older children.[7]In September 2018, YouTube added new age group options relating to content offered in the app, \"Younger\" and \"Older\". \"Younger\" maintains the existing mix of content offered before, and \"Older\" adds more content from other genres, such as nature, gaming, and music.[14] In August 2019, the \"Younger\" setting was split to add a new \"Preschool\" group, with a focus on \"creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration\".[15]The YouTube Kids app features parental control settings which allow parents to set time limits, and restrict users from accessing the search tool. Parents can use a passcode or their Google account to protect these settings, and configure profiles for multiple users to tailor their experiences.[16][7]The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) and the Center for Digital Democracy (CDD) both expressed concern over the use of advertising within the YouTube Kids app, arguing that children would not be able to distinguish the ads from content. Short bumpers were later added to the app in order to establish a separation between advertising and content.[17]The YouTube Kids app has faced criticism over the accessibility of videos that are inappropriate for its target audience. The CCFC filed an FTC complaint over YouTube Kids shortly after its release, citing examples of inappropriate videos that were accessible via the app's search tool (such as those related to wine in their testing), and the Recommended page eventually using search history to surface such videos. YouTube defended the criticism, stating that it was developed in consultation with other advocacy groups, and that the company was open to feedback over the app's operation.[18][19] A larger YouTube controversy referred to as \"Elsagate\" has also been associated with the app, referring to channels which post videos featuring characters from popular franchises (especially, among others, Frozen, Paw Patrol, Peppa Pig, and Spider-Man), but with disturbing, sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise inappropriate themes and content.[20]YouTube global head of family and children's content Malik Ducard admitted that \"making the app family friendly is of the utmost importance to us\", but admitted that the service was not curated all the time, and that parents had the responsibility to use the app's parental controls to control how it is used by their children (including disabling access to the search tool).[21] Josh Golin, director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, argued that automated algorithms were not enough to determine whether a video is age-appropriate, and that the process required manual curation.[21] He added that \"the YouTube model has created something, which is so vast, but there are 400 hours of content are uploaded every minute. It's simply too big. People have been raising these issues for years, just visit any parenting forum and theyâve been talking about the fake Peppa Pig videos.\"[18]In November 2017, YouTube announced that it would take further steps to review and filter videos reported by users as containing inappropriate content, including more stringent use of its filtering and age-restriction system to prevent such videos from appearing on the app and YouTube proper.[22] In an update to the YouTube Kids app that month, a more prominent disclaimer was added to its first-time setup process, stating that the service can not fully guarantee the appropriateness of videos that were not manually curated, and informing parents of means to report and block videos that they do not find suitable.[7]These options expanded further in 2018, with the addition of an option to restrict users to human-reviewed channels and recommendations, as well as a manual whitelisting system.[23][14]"

These subscription benefits are also offered to subscribers of Google Play Music and YouTube Premium.The YouTube Music app was unveiled in October 2015 and released the following month; its release came alongside the unveiling of YouTube Red, a larger subscription service that covers the entirety of the YouTube platform, including the Music app. Although redundant to Google's existing Google Play Music All Access subscription service, the app is designed for users who primarily consume music through YouTube.[4][5]On May 17, 2018, YouTube announced a new version of the YouTube Music service, including a web-based desktop player and redesigned mobile app, more dynamic recommendations based on various factors, and use of Google artificial intelligence technology to search songs based on lyrics and descriptions. In addition, YouTube Music became a separate subscription service (positioned as a more direct competitor to Apple Music and Spotify), offering ad-free and background/audio-only streaming, and downloading for offline playback, for music content on YouTube. The service's benefits will continue to be available as part of the existing YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) service, and to Google Play Music All Access subscribers. The YouTube Music subscription is priced in line with its competitors at US$9.99 per-month; the price of YouTube Premium was concurrently increased to $11.99 for new subscribers.[6][7]In 2018, YouTube Music reached multiple sponsorship agreements with Dick Clark Productions to serve as a partner for its television specials Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve and the American Music Awards.[8][9]The availability of music includes many of the releases from mainstream artists and extends to any video categorized as music on the YouTube service.YouTube Music will initially operate in parallel with Google Play Music, but product manager Elias Roman stated that Google Play Music users will eventually be migrated to YouTube Music after it reaches feature parity (including the addition of features such as music purchases and a cloud-based library for user-provided music). YouTube Music product manager T. Jay Fowler stated that collections, playlists and preferences would be migrated.[10] Beginning in September 2019, Google Play Music is replaced by YouTube Music in the core Google mobile services bundle distributed on new Android devices.[11][12]YouTube Music became available on Google Assistant smart speakers (including Google Home) on April 18, 2019, with feature-limited ad-supported playback available for non-subscribers.[13]The free tier usually plays songs in its versions of music video where applicable. The premium tier plays official tracks of the album, unless the user searches for the music video version. YouTube Music Premium subscribers are able to switch to an audio-only mode that can play in the background while the application is not in use. The free tier does not allow audio-only mode with background playback as it displays video advertisements.[5]The Premium and YouTube Premium plans are available in individual and family variants. A family plan allows up to six family members from the same household to access plan features. Eligible students can obtain a discount on an individual plan.The service is available in 73 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong SAR (China), Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Moldova, Malta, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, North Macedonia, Norway, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey , Thailand , Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States and Uruguay.[14][15][16]"

        "name": "YouTube TV",
        "text": "YouTube TV is an American over-the-top internet television service that offers live TV, on demand video and cloud-based DVR from more than 70[1] television networks. It is owned by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. YouTube TV's line up includes major U.S. networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, FX, AMC, CNN, Fox News, TBS, Discovery, and ESPN.[2]YouTube TV launched on February 28, 2017.[3]YouTube TV began streaming in April 2017 in five U.S. markets - New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco,[3][4] In addition to national U.S. networks, YouTube TV broadcasts channels owned by those networks, their corporate owners and other media companies. Other channels include CNBC, MSNBC, Fox News, BBC World News, The Smithsonian Channel (a venture by CBS-owned Showtime Networks and the Smithsonian Institution); Sundance TV (owned by AMC Networks); numerous sports channels; Disney Channel (owned by The Walt Disney Company); and BBC America (jointly owned by AMC Networks and BBC Studios). YouTube TV members also have access to YouTube Premium original movies and shows (although a YouTube Premium subscription is not included with YouTube TV).[5]Also in 2017, YouTube added MLB Network and regional deals with the Seattle Sounders and Los Angeles FC of Major League Soccer.[6][7]On February 14, 2018, YouTube TV began carrying the Time Warner-owned Turner Broadcasting System's cable networks (including, among others, TBS, TNT, CNN and Cartoon Network). In addition, YouTube TV also announced deal to add NBA TV and MLB Network.[8]The service expanded to cover 98 percent of U.S. households in January 2019.[9] In March 2019, YouTube TV launched in Glendive, Montana, thus becoming available in every TV market in the United States.[10]On April 10, 2019, YouTube TV added nine networks owned by Discovery, Inc. (which include Discovery Channel, Travel Channel, HGTV and Food Network). This brought YouTube TV to more than 70 channels. Google also announced that they would be adding the Oprah Winfrey Network.[1] The monthly price for all customers increased by about 42% compared to the launch price, and 25% compared to the March 2018 price, with no grandfathering available.[11]On July 29, 2019, at the Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour in Pasadena, California, YouTube TV announced it had signed a landmark multi-year deal with PBS to allow carriage of live streams of PBS member stations and PBS Kids Channel beginning as early as the fourth quarter of 2019 (just before or after the November pledge drives of select PBS stations). The deal â which is PBSâs first distribution agreement with a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) â would allow PBS stations the option of providing the direct over-the-air signals of local stations if they are able to clear the rights to at least 90% of their programming, a YouTube TV-exclusive dedicated feed in which shows that local PBS members are not able to clear for digital streaming would be replaced with separate programming or a PBS-provided national feed that would include programs fully cleared by the public broadcaster and localized station ID inserts (omitting local programs or pledge drives), and would allow YouTube TV to provide streams of up to three PBS member stations within a given market. Stations that choose to offer their main signal must notify YouTube TV if they plan to air a show without rights clearances, in which the service will replace the program with a blackout notice screen.[12]YouTube TV offers a cloud-based DVR service with unlimited storage that saves recordings for nine months. Each subscription can be shared among six accounts and allows up to three simultaneous streams.Supported YouTube TV devices include:"
