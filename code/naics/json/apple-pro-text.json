        "name": "Mac",
        "text": "The Macintosh (/ˈmækɪntɒʃ/ MAK-in-tosh; branded simply as Mac since 1998) is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984.The original Macintosh was the first mass-market personal computer that featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen and mouse.[1] (Although the Sinclair QL became available one month before the Macintosh family and thus was technically the first home computer with a graphical user interface, the QL never attained widespread commercial success.) Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years before they were discontinued in 1993.Early Macintosh models were expensive,[2] hindering its competitiveness in a market dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses.[3] Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time. However, the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel's Pentium processor which beat the Motorola 68040 in most benchmarks gradually took market share from Apple, and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh line in the mid-1990s, the falling prices of commodity PC components, poor inventory management with the Macintosh Performa, and the release of Windows 95 saw the Macintosh user base decline.Prompted by the returning Steve Jobs' belief that the Macintosh line had become too complex, Apple consolidated nearly twenty models in mid-1997 (including models made for specific regions) down to four in mid-1999: The Power Macintosh G3, iMac, 14.1\" PowerBook G3, and 12\" iBook. All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance, competitive prices and aesthetic designs, and helped return Apple to profitability. Around this time, Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of \"Mac\", a nickname that had been in common use since the development of the first model. Since their transition to Intel processors in 2006, the complete lineup is Intel based. Its current lineup includes four desktops (the all-in-one iMac and iMac Pro, and the desktop Mac Mini and Mac Pro), and two laptops (the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro). Its Xserve server was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.Apple has also developed a series of Macintosh operating systems. The first versions initially had no name but came to be known as the \"Macintosh System Software\" in 1988, \"Mac OS\" in 1997 with the release of Mac OS 7.6, and retrospectively called \"Classic Mac OS\". In 2001, Apple released Mac OS X, a modern Unix-based operating system which was later rebranded to simply OS X in 2012, and then macOS in 2016. The current version is macOS Catalina, released on October 7, 2019.[4] Intel-based Macs are capable of running non-Apple operating systems such as Linux, OpenBSD, and Microsoft Windows with the aid of Boot Camp or third-party software. Apple also produced a Unix-based operating system for the Macintosh called A/UX from 1988 to 1995, which closely resembled contemporary versions of the Macintosh system software. Apple does not license macOS for use on non-Apple computers, however System 7 was licensed to various companies through Apple's Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997. Only one company, UMAX Technologies was legally licensed to ship clones running Mac OS 8.[5] Since Apple's transition to Intel processors, there is a sizeable community around the world that specialises in hacking macOS to run on non-Apple computers, which are called \"Hackintoshes\".The Macintosh project began in 1979 when Jef Raskin, an Apple employee, envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh,[6] but the spelling was changed to \"Macintosh\" for legal reasons as the original was the same spelling as that used by McIntosh Laboratory, Inc., the audio equipment manufacturer.[7] Steve Jobs requested that McIntosh Laboratory give Apple a release for the newly spelled name, thus allowing Apple to use it. The request was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use this name.[8] (A 1984 Byte Magazine article suggested Apple changed the spelling only after \"early users\" misspelled \"McIntosh\".[9] However, Jef Raskin had adopted the \"Macintosh\" spelling by 1981,[10] when the Macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab. This explanation further clashes with the first explanation given above that the change was made for \"legal reasons.\")In 1978 Apple began to organize the Apple Lisa project, aiming to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced Apple II or the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC. In 1979 Steve Jobs learned of the advanced work on graphical user interfaces (GUI) taking place at Xerox PARC. He arranged for Apple engineers to be allowed to visit PARC to see the systems in action.[11] The Apple Lisa project was immediately redirected to utilize a GUI, which at that time was well beyond the state of the art for microprocessor capabilities; the Xerox Alto required a custom processor that spanned several circuit boards in a case which was the size of a small refrigerator. Things had changed dramatically with the introduction of the 32-bit Motorola 68000 in 1979, which offered at least an order of magnitude better performance than existing designs, and made a software GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs's continual suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.[12]At the same time that the Lisa was becoming a GUI machine in 1979, Jef Raskin started the Macintosh project. The design at that time was for a low-cost, easy-to-use machine for the average consumer. Instead of a GUI, it intended to use a text-based user interface that allowed several programs to be running and easily switched between, and special command keys on the keyboard that accessed standardized commands in the programs. Raskin was authorized to start hiring for the project in September 1979,[13] and he immediately asked his long-time colleague, Brian Howard, to join him.[14] His initial team would eventually consist of himself, Howard, Joanna Hoffman, Burrell Smith, and Bud Tribble.[15] The rest of the original Mac team would include Bill Atkinson, Bob Belleville, Steve Capps, George Crow, Donn Denman, Chris Espinosa, Andy Hertzfeld, Bruce Horn, Susan Kare, Larry Kenyon, and Caroline Rose with Steve Jobs leading the project.[16] In a 2013 interview, Steve Wozniak insinuated that he had been leading the initial design and development phase of the Macintosh project until 1981 when he experienced a traumatic airplane crash and temporarily left the company, at which point Jobs took over. In that same interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh \"failed\" under Jobs, and that it was not until Jobs left that it became a success. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John Sculley \"who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away\".[17]Smith's first Macintosh board was built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64 kilobytes (kB) of RAM, used the 8-bit Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of supporting a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display. Bud Tribble, a member of the Mac team, was interested in running the Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa's 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but increased its speed from the Lisa's 5 MHz to 8 MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64 KB of ROM – far more than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8 KB of ROM; it had 128 kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-kilobit (kb) RAM chips soldered to the logicboard. Although there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512 kB by means of soldering sixteen IC sockets to accept 256 kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's screen was a 9-inch (230 mm), 512x342 pixel monochrome display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.[18]Burrell's innovative design, combining the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa's Motorola 68000 CPU, began to receive Jobs's attentions.[19] InfoWorld in September 1981 reported on the existence of the secret Lisa and \"McIntosh\" projects at Apple. Stating that they and another computer \"are all scheduled to be ready for release within a year\", it described McIntosh as a portable computer with the 68000 and 128KB memory, and possibly battery-powered.[20] Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, Jobs began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. After development had completed, team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs's ideas than Raskin's.[13] When Jobs was forced out of the Lisa team in 1982, he devoted his entire attentions to the Macintosh.Jobs commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the \"Snow White\" design language; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers.[21]In 1982 Regis McKenna was brought in to shape the marketing and launch of the Macintosh.[22] Later the Regis McKenna team grew to include Jane Anderson, Katie Cadigan and Andy Cunningham,[23] who eventually led the Apple account for the agency.[24] Cunningham and Anderson were the primary authors of the Macintosh launch plan.[25][26][27] The launch of the Macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products, including the \"multiple exclusive,\" event marketing (credited to John Sculley, who brought the concept over from Pepsi), creating a mystique around a product and giving an inside look into a product's creation.[28]After the Lisa's announcement, John Dvorak discussed rumors of a mysterious \"MacIntosh\" project at Apple in February 1983.[29] The company announced the Macintosh 128K—manufactured at an Apple factory in Fremont, California—in October 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December.[30][31] The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, \"1984\".[32] It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and is now considered a \"watershed event\"[33] and a \"masterpiece.\"[34] McKenna called the ad \"more successful than the Mac itself.\"[35] \"1984\" used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the \"conformity\" of IBM's attempts to dominate the computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised \"Big Brother.\"[36][37]Two days after \"1984\" aired, the Macintosh went on sale, and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: MacWrite and MacPaint. It was first demonstrated by Steve Jobs in the first of his famous Mac keynote speeches, and though the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, some labeled it a mere \"toy.\"[38] Because the operating system was designed largely around the GUI, existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten. This was a time-consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake, and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984, Microsoft's MultiPlan migrated over from MS-DOS, with Microsoft Word following in January 1985.[39] In 1985 Lotus Software introduced Lotus Jazz for the Macintosh platform after the success of Lotus 1-2-3 for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop.[40] Apple introduced the Macintosh Office suite the same year with the \"Lemmings\" ad. Infamous for insulting its own potential customers, the ad was not successful.[41]Apple spent $2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special, post-election issue of Newsweek,[42] and ran a \"Test Drive a Macintosh\" promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from $1,995 to $2,495 (equivalent to $5,800 in 2018).[2][41] The computer sold well, nonetheless, reportedly outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year; one dealer reported a backlog of more than 600 orders.[43][44] By April 1984 the company sold 50,000 Macintoshes, and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year.[45]Most Apple II sales had once been to companies, but the IBM PC caused small businesses, schools, and some homes to become Apple's main customers.[46] Jobs stated during the Macintosh's introduction \"we expect Macintosh to become the third industry standard\", after the Apple II and IBM PC. Although outselling every other computer, and so compelling that one dealer described it as \"the first $2,500 impulse item\", Macintosh did not meet expectations during the first year, especially among business customers. Only about ten applications including MacWrite and MacPaint were widely available,[43][47] although many non-Apple software developers participated in the introduction and Apple promised that 79 companies including Lotus, Digital Research, and Ashton-Tate were creating products for the new computer. After one year for each computer, the Macintosh had less than one quarter of the PC's software selection—including only one word processor, two databases, and one spreadsheet—although Apple had sold 280,000 Macintoshes compared to IBM's first year sales of fewer than 100,000 PCs.[48]Although Macintosh excited software developers,[43] they were required to learn how to write software that used the graphic user interface,[48] and early in the computer's history needed a Lisa 2 or Unix system to write Macintosh software.[49] Infocom had developed the only third-party games for the Mac's launch by replacing the buggy early operating system with the company's own minimal bootable game platform.[50] Despite standardizing on Pascal for software development Apple did not release a native-code Pascal compiler. Until third-party Pascal compilers appeared, developers had to write software in other languages while still learning enough Pascal to understand Inside Macintosh.[51] MacWrite's inclusion with the Macintosh discouraged developers from creating other word processing software.[52]The Macintosh 128K, originally released as the Apple Macintosh, is the original Apple Macintosh personal computer. Its beige case consisted of a 9 in (23 cm) CRT monitor and came with a keyboard and mouse. A handle built into the top of the case made it easier for the computer to be lifted and carried. This was synonymous with the release of the iconic 1984 TV Advertisement by Apple. This model and the 512k released in September of the same year had signatures of the core team embossed inside the hard plastic cover, and soon became collector pieces.In 1985 the combination of the Mac, Apple's LaserWriter printer, and Mac-specific software like Boston Software's MacPublisher and Aldus PageMaker enabled users to design, preview, and print page layouts complete with text and graphics—an activity to become known as desktop publishing. Initially, desktop publishing was unique to the Macintosh, but eventually became available for other platforms.[53] Later, applications such as Macromedia FreeHand, QuarkXPress, and Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator strengthened the Mac's position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging desktop publishing market.The Macintosh's minimal memory became apparent, even compared with other personal computers in 1984, and could not be expanded easily. It also lacked a hard disk drive or the means to easily attach one. Many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue. Suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to 512 KB or removing the computer's 16 memory chips and replacing them with larger-capacity chips, a tedious and difficult operation. In October 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh 512K, with quadruple the memory of the original, at a price of US$3,195.[54] It also offered an upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing the logic board.Apple released the Macintosh Plus on January 10, 1986, for a price of US$2,600. It offered one megabyte of RAM, easily expandable to four megabytes by the use of socketed RAM boards. It also featured a SCSI parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals—such as hard drives and scanners—to be attached to the machine. Its floppy drive was increased to an 800 kB capacity. The Mac Plus was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for just over four years and ten months, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history[55] until the 2nd generation Mac Pro that was introduced on December 19, 2013 surpassed this record on September 18, 2018. In September 1986 Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or MPW, an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than cross compiling from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled HyperCard and MultiFinder, which added cooperative multitasking to the Macintosh. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.Updated Motorola CPUs made a faster machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took advantage of the new Motorola technology and introduced the Macintosh II at $5500, powered by a 16 MHz Motorola 68020 processor.[56] The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an open architecture with several NuBus expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud.[57] One third-party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty.[58] Later Macintosh computers had quieter power supplies and hard drives.The Macintosh SE was released at the same time as the Macintosh II for $2900 (or $3900 with hard drive), as the first compact Mac with a 20 MB internal hard drive and an expansion slot.[59] The SE's expansion slot was located inside the case along with the CRT, potentially exposing an upgrader to high voltage. For this reason, Apple recommended users bring their SE to an authorized Apple dealer to have upgrades performed.[60] The SE also updated Jerry Manock and Terry Oyama's original design and shared the Macintosh II's Snow White design language, as well as the new Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) mouse and keyboard that had first appeared on the Apple IIGS some months earlier.In 1987 Apple spun off its software business as Claris. It was given the code and rights to several applications, most notably MacWrite, MacPaint, and MacProject. In the late 1980s Claris released a number of revamped software titles; the result was the \"Pro\" series, including MacDraw Pro, MacWrite Pro, and FileMaker Pro. To provide a complete office suite, Claris purchased the rights to the Informix Wingz spreadsheet program on the Mac, renaming it Claris Resolve, and added the new presentation software Claris Impact. By the early 1990s, Claris applications were shipping with the majority of consumer-level Macintoshes and were extremely popular. In 1991 Claris released ClarisWorks, which soon became their second best-selling application. When Claris was reincorporated back into Apple in 1998, ClarisWorks was renamed AppleWorks beginning with version 5.0.[61]In 1988 Apple sued Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard on the grounds that they infringed Apple's copyrighted GUI, citing (among other things) the use of rectangular, overlapping, and resizable windows. After four years, the case was decided against Apple, as were later appeals. Apple's actions were criticized by some in the software community, including the Free Software Foundation (FSF), who felt Apple was trying to monopolize on GUIs in general, and boycotted GNU software for the Macintosh platform for seven years.[62][63]With the new Motorola 68030 processor came the Macintosh IIx in 1988, which had benefited from internal improvements, including an on-board MMU.[64] It was followed in 1989 by the Macintosh IIcx, a more compact version with fewer slots [65] and a version of the Mac SE powered by the 16 MHz 68030, the Macintosh SE/30.[66] Later that year, the Macintosh IIci, running at 25 MHz, was the first Mac to be \"32-bit clean.\" This allowed it to natively support more than 8 MB of RAM,[67] unlike its predecessors, which had \"32-bit dirty\" ROMs (8 of the 32 bits available for addressing were used for OS-level flags). System 7 was the first Macintosh operating system to support 32-bit addressing.[68] The following year, the Macintosh IIfx, starting at US$9,900, was unveiled. Apart from its fast 40 MHz 68030 processor, it had significant internal architectural improvements, including faster memory and two Apple II CPUs (6502s) dedicated to I/O processing.[69]Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990, and according to a common saying at the time \"Windows was not as good as Macintosh, but it was good enough for the average user\". Although still a graphical wrapper that relied upon MS-DOS, 3.0 was the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the much more expensive Macintosh platform. It also did not help matters that during the previous year Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers. Finally, there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry in 1989, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices, which dropped Apple's margins.[70]In response, Apple introduced a range of relatively inexpensive Macs in October 1990. The Macintosh Classic, essentially a less expensive version of the Macintosh SE, was the least expensive Mac offered until early 2001.[71] The 68020-powered Macintosh LC, in its distinctive \"pizza box\" case, offered color graphics and was accompanied by a new, low-cost 512×384 pixel monitor.[72] The Macintosh IIsi was essentially a 20 MHz IIci with only one expansion slot.[73] All three machines sold well,[74] although Apple's profit margin on them was considerably lower than that on earlier models.[71]Apple improved Macintosh computers by introducing models equipped with newly available processors from the 68k lineup. The Macintosh Classic II[75] and Macintosh LC II, which used a 16 MHz 68030 CPU,[76] were joined in 1991 by the Macintosh Quadra 700[77] and 900,[78] the first Macs to employ the faster Motorola 68040 processor.Apple released their first portable computer, the Macintosh Portable in 1989. Although due to considerable design issues, it was soon replaced in 1991 with the first of the PowerBook line: the PowerBook 100, a miniaturized portable; the 16 MHz 68030 PowerBook 140; and the 25 MHz 68030 PowerBook 170.[79] They were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest and a built-in pointing device (a trackball) in front of the keyboard.[80] The 1993 PowerBook 165c was Apple's first portable computer to feature a color screen, displaying 256 colors with 640 × 400-pixel resolution.[81] The second generation of PowerBooks, the 68040-equipped 500 series, introduced trackpads, integrated stereo speakers, and built-in Ethernet to the laptop form factor in 1994.[82]As for Mac OS, System 7 introduced a form of virtual memory, improved the performance of color graphics, and gained standard co-operative multitasking. Also during this time, the Macintosh began to shed the \"Snow White\" design language, along with the expensive consulting fees they were paying to Frogdesign. Apple instead brought the design work in-house by establishing the Apple Industrial Design Group, becoming responsible for crafting a new look for all Apple products.[83]Intel had tried unsuccessfully to push Apple to migrate the Macintosh platform to Intel chips. Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors.[84] While the Motorola 68040 offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents.[85][86] Apple's product design and engineering did not help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series, several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops hit the market which cost Apple considerable sales. In 1993 Intel rolled out the Pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology. In 1994 Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the RISC PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola.[87] The Power Macintosh line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months.[88] However, in the long run, spurning Intel for the PowerPC was a mistake as the commoditization of Intel-architecture chips meant Apple couldn't compete on price against \"the Dells of the world\".[84]Notwithstanding these technical and commercial successes on the Macintosh, the falling costs of components made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption, over Macintosh systems that remained fairly expensive. A successful price war initiated by Compaq vaulted them from third place to first among PC manufacturers in 1994, overtaking a struggling IBM and relegating Apple to third place.[89][90][91]Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers. At one point, its product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, Performa, and Centris models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.[92] These models competed against Macintosh clones, hardware manufactured by third parties to whom Apple had licensed System 7. This succeeded in increasing the Macintosh's market share somewhat, and provided cheaper hardware for consumers, but hurt Apple financially as existing Apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of Apple's higher-margin Macintosh systems, while Apple continued to bear the burden of developing Mac OS.Apple's market share further struggled due to the release of the Windows 95 operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of IBM PC compatible computers, and brought the capabilities of Windows substantially nearer to parity with Mac OS.When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 following the company's purchase of NeXT, he ordered that the OS that had been previewed as System 7.7 be branded Mac OS 8, a name Apple had previously wished to preserve for the never-to-appear next generation Copland OS. This maneuver effectively ended the clone lines, as Apple had only licensed System 7 to clone manufacturers, not Mac OS 8. The decision caused significant financial losses for companies like Motorola, who produced the StarMax; Umax, who produced the SuperMac;[93] and Power Computing, who offered several lines of Mac clones, including the PowerWave, PowerTower, and PowerTower Pro.[94] These companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own Mac-compatible hardware.[95] Apple bought out Power Computing's license, but allowed Umax to continue selling Mac clones until their license expired, as they had a sizeable presence in the lower-end segment that Apple did not. In September 1997 Apple extended Umax' license allowing them to sell clones with Mac OS 8, the only clone maker to do so, but with the restriction that they only sell low-end systems. Without the higher profit margins of high-end systems, however, Umax judged this would not be profitable and exited the Mac clone market in May 1998, having lost US$36 million on the program.[96][97][98]In 1998 Apple introduced its new iMac which, like the original 128K Mac, was an all-in-one computer. Its translucent plastic case, originally Bondi blue and later various additional colors, is considered an industrial design landmark of the late 1990s. The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as SCSI and ADB, in favor of two USB ports.[100] It replaced a floppy disk drive with a CD-ROM drive for installing software,[101][102] but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 139 days.[103] It made the company an annual profit of US$309 million, Apple's first profitable year since Michael Spindler took over as CEO in 1995.[104] This aesthetic was applied to the Power Macintosh and later the iBook, Apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of Apple's \"four-square product matrix\" (desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals).[105] More than 140,000 pre-orders were placed before it started shipping in September,[106] and by October proved to be a large success.[107]The iMac also marked Apple's transition from the \"Macintosh\" name to the more simplistic \"Mac\". Apple completed elimination of the Macintosh product name in 1999, when \"Power Macintosh\" was retired with the introduction of the Power Mac G4.In early 2001 Apple began shipping computers with CD-RW drives and emphasized the Mac's ability to play DVDs by including DVD-ROM and DVD-RAM drives as standard.[108] Steve Jobs admitted that Apple had been \"late to the party\" on writable CD technology, but felt that Macs could become a \"digital hub\" that linked and enabled an \"emerging digital lifestyle\".[109] Apple would later introduce an update to its iTunes music player software that enabled it to burn CDs, along with a controversial \"Rip, Mix, Burn\" advertising campaign that some[110] felt encouraged media piracy.[111] This accompanied the release of the iPod, Apple's first successful handheld device. Apple continued to launch products, such as the unsuccessful Power Mac G4 Cube,[112] the education-oriented eMac, and the titanium (and later aluminium) PowerBook G4 laptop for professionals.The original iMac used a PowerPC G3 processor, but G4 and G5 chips were soon added, both accompanied by complete case redesigns that dropped the array of colors in favor of white plastic. As of 2007, all iMacs use aluminium cases. On January 11, 2005, Apple announced the Mac Mini, priced at US$499, making it the cheapest Mac.[113][114]Mac OS continued to evolve up to version 9.2.2, including retrofits such as the addition of a nanokernel and support for Multiprocessing Services 2.0 in Mac OS 8.6, though its dated architecture made replacement necessary.[115] From its beginnings on an 8 MHz machine with 128 KB of RAM, it had grown to support Apple's latest 1 GHz G4-equipped Macs. Since its architecture was laid down, features that were already common on Apple's competition, like preemptive multitasking and protected memory, had become feasible on the kind of hardware Apple manufactured. As such, Apple introduced Mac OS X, a fully overhauled Unix-based successor to Mac OS 9. OS X uses Darwin, XNU, and Mach as foundations, and is based on NeXTSTEP. It was released to the public in September 2000 as the Mac OS X Public Beta, featuring a revamped user interface called \"Aqua\". At US$29.99, it allowed adventurous Mac users to sample Apple's new operating system and provide feedback for the actual release.[116] The initial version of Mac OS X, 10.0 \"Cheetah\", was released on March 24, 2001. Older Mac OS applications could still run under early Mac OS X versions, using an environment called \"Classic\". Subsequent releases of Mac OS X included 10.1 \"Puma\" (2001), 10.2 \"Jaguar\" (2002), 10.3 \"Panther\" (2003) and 10.4 \"Tiger\" (2005).Apple discontinued the use of PowerPC processors in 2006. At WWDC 2005, Steve Jobs announced this transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and PowerPC architectures.[117] This was done in order to make the company's computer more modern, keeping pace with Intel's low power Pentium M chips, especially for heat-sensitive laptops.[118] The PowerPC G5 chip's heavy power consumption and heat output (the Power Mac G5 had to be liquid-cooled) also prevented its use in Mac notebook computers (as well as the original Mac mini), which were forced to use the older and slower PowerPC G4 chip. These shortcomings of the PowerPC chips were the main reasons behind Apple's transition to Intel processors, and the brand was revitalised by the subsequent boost in processing power available due to greater efficiency and the ability to implement multiple cores in Mac CPUs.All new Macs now use x86-64 processors made by Intel, and some were renamed as a result.[119] Intel-based Macs running OS X 10.6 and below (support has been discontinued since 10.7) can run pre-existing software developed for PowerPC using an emulator named Rosetta,[120] although at noticeably slower speeds than native programs. However, the Classic environment is now unavailable on the Intel architecture. Intel chips introduced the potential to run the Microsoft Windows operating system natively on Apple hardware, without emulation software such as Virtual PC. In March 2006 a group of hackers announced that they were able to run Windows XP on an Intel-based Mac. The group released their software as open source and has posted it for download on their website.[121] On April 5, 2006, Apple announced the availability of the public beta of Boot Camp, software that allows owners of Intel-based Macs to install Windows XP on their machines; later versions added support for Windows Vista and Windows 7. Classic was discontinued in Mac OS X 10.5, and Boot Camp became a standard feature on Intel-based Macs.[122][123]Starting in 2006, Apple's industrial design shifted to favor aluminum, which was used in the construction of the first MacBook Pro. Glass was added in 2008 with the introduction of the unibody MacBook Pro. These materials are billed as environmentally friendly.[124] The iMac, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini lines currently all use aluminum enclosures, and are now made of a single unibody.[125][126][127] Chief designer Sir Jonathan Ive continues to guide products towards a minimalist and simple feel,[128][129] including eliminating of replaceable batteries in notebooks.[130] Multi-touch gestures from the iPhone's interface have been applied to the Mac line in the form of touch pads on notebooks and the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad for desktops.On February 24, 2011, Apple became the first company to bring to market a computer that utilized Intel's new Thunderbolt (codename Light Peak) I/O interface. Using the same physical interface as a Mini DisplayPort, and backwards compatible with that standard, Thunderbolt boasts two-way transfer speeds of 10 Gbit/s.[131]In April 2018 Bloomberg reported that Apple intends to drop Intel chips and replace them with an \"In-house\" version, which caused Intel's shares to fall 6%. According to the report, the switch might happen as early as the year 2020.[132]Also in April 2018, The Verge made an article[133] about how Intel is stagnating and not making any significant improvements to its lineup and could not compete for battery life with ARM chips, commonly found in smartphones.Source: Glen Sanford, Apple History, apple-history.comApple contracts hardware production to Asian original equipment manufacturers such as Foxconn and Pegatron, maintaining a high degree of control over the end product. By contrast, most other companies (including Microsoft) create software that can be run on hardware produced by a variety of third parties such as Dell, HP Inc./Hewlett-Packard/Compaq, and Lenovo. Consequently, the Macintosh buyer has comparably fewer options, but has superior integration compared to a Microsoft buyer.The current Mac product family uses Intel x86-64 processors. Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), much as it did during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture,[134] and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8 GB of RAM as standard. Current Mac computers use ATI/AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the Retina MacBook, which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the \"Thunderbolt\" port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second.[135] USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today,[101] while FireWire was mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.[136][137]Apple was initially reluctant to embrace mice with multiple buttons and scroll wheels. Macs did not natively support pointing devices that featured multiple buttons, even from third parties, until Mac OS X arrived in 2001.[138] Apple continued to offer only single button mice, in both wired and Bluetooth wireless versions, until August 2005, when it introduced the Mighty Mouse. While it looked like a traditional one-button mouse, it actually had four buttons and a scroll ball, capable of independent x- and y-axis movement.[139] A Bluetooth version followed in July 2006.[140] In October 2009, Apple introduced the Magic Mouse, which uses multi-touch gesture recognition (similar to that of the iPhone) instead of a physical scroll wheel or ball.[141] It is available only in a wireless configuration, but the wired Mighty Mouse (re-branded as \"Apple Mouse\") was still available as an alternative until its discontinuation in 2017. Since 2010, Apple has also offered the Magic Trackpad as a means to control Macintosh desktop computers in a way similar to laptops.The original Macintosh was the first successful personal computer to use a graphical user interface devoid of a command line. It uses a desktop metaphor, depicting real-world objects like documents and a trash can as icons on-screen. Now known as the classic Mac OS, the System software was introduced in 1984 with the first Macintosh, renamed Mac OS in 1997, and continued to evolve until version 9.2.2.Originally, the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the classic Mac OS system that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system. The most common workaround, is to boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a Mac OS-based bootloader application. Used even by Apple for A/UX and MkLinux, this technique is no longer necessary since the introduction of Open Firmware-based PCI Macs, though it was formerly used for convenience on many Old World ROM systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation. Since then, Mac hardware boots directly from Open Firmware in most PowerPC-based Macs or EFI in all Intel-based Macs.[citation needed]In 2001, Apple introduced Mac OS X (renamed OS X in 2012 and macOS in 2016), based on Darwin and NeXTSTEP; its new features included the Dock and the Aqua user interface. During the transition, Apple included a virtual machine subsystem known as Classic, allowing users to run Mac OS 9 applications under Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier on PowerPC machines. Because macOS is a Unix operating system that borrows heavily from FreeBSD, many applications written for Linux or BSD run on it, often using X11. There are many popular Macintosh software applications; many of those from large developers, such as Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop are actively developed for both macOS and Windows. A large amount of open-source software applications, such as the Firefox web browser and the LibreOffice office suite, are cross-platform, and thereby also run natively on macOS.Following the release of Intel-based Macs, third-party platform virtualization software such as Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion, and VirtualBox began to emerge. These programs allow users to run Microsoft Windows or previously Windows-only software on Macs at near native speed. Apple also released Boot Camp and Mac-specific Windows drivers that help users to install Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 and natively dual boot between Mac OS X and Windows. Although not condoned by Apple, it is possible to run the Linux operating system using Boot camp or other virtualization workarounds.[142][143] Unlike most PCs, however, Macs are unable to run many legacy PC operating systems. In particular, Intel-based Macs lack the A20 gate.[citation needed]Since the introduction of the Macintosh, Apple has struggled to gain a significant share of the personal computer market. At first, the Macintosh 128K suffered from a dearth of available software compared to IBM's PC, resulting in disappointing sales in 1984 and 1985. It took 74 days for 50,000 units to sell.[144] Although Apple was not able to overcome the tidal wave of IBM PCs and its clones,[3][145][146][147][148][148] Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing.Notwithstanding these technical and commercial successes on the Macintosh platform, their systems remained fairly expensive, making them less competitive in light of the falling costs of components that made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption. In 1989, Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers, then there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry that year, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple's margins. Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990, the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the significantly costlier Macintosh.[70] Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers; at one point the product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, Performa, and Centris models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.[92]Compaq, who had previously held the third place spot among PC manufacturers during the 1980s and early/mid-1990s, initiated a successful price war in 1994 that vaulted them to the biggest by the year end, overtaking a struggling IBM and relegating Apple to third place.[89][90][91] Apple's market share further struggled due to the release of the Windows 95 operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of IBM PC compatible computers, and brought the capabilities of Windows to parity with the Mac OS GUI.In 1997, upon return to Apple as interim CEO, Steve Jobs terminated the Macintosh clone program while simplifying the computer product lines. If measuring market share by installed base, there were more than 20 million Mac users by 1997, compared to an installed base of around 340 million Windows PCs.[149][150]In 1998, the release of the iMac G3 all-in-one was a great success, selling 800,000 units in 139 days, providing a much needed boost to the ailing Macintosh platform.[103][104] The introduction of the Power Macintosh and iBook laptop completed \"four-square product matrix\" (desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals), with the iBook ranking as the most popular laptop in the U.S. market for 1999.[105][106][107]In 2000, Apple released the Power Mac G4 Cube, their first desktop since the discontinued Power Macintosh G3, to slot between the iMac G3 and the Power Mac G4. Even with its innovative design, it was initially priced US$200 higher than the comparably-equipped and more-expandable base Power Mac G4, while also not including a monitor, making it too expensive and resulting in slow sales.[151] Apple sold just 29,000 Cubes in Q4 of 2000 which was one third of expectations, compared to 308,000 Macs during that same quarter, and Cube sales dropped to 12,000 units in Q1 of 2001.[152] A price drop and hardware upgrades could not offset the earlier perception of the Cube's reduced value compared to the iMac and Power Mac G4 lineup, and it was discontinued in July 2001.[153]Starting in 2002, Apple moved to eliminate CRT displays from its product line as part of aesthetic design and space-saving measures with the iMac G4. However, the new iMac with its flexible LCD flat-panel monitor was considerably more expensive on its debut than the preceding iMac G3, largely due to the higher cost of the LCD technology at the time. In order to keep the Macintosh affordable for the education market and due to obsolescence of the iMac G3, Apple created the eMac in April 2002 as the intended successor; however the eMac's CRT made it relatively bulky and somewhat outdated, while its all-in-one construction meant it could not be expanded to meet consumer demand for larger monitors. The iMac G4's relatively high prices were approaching that of laptops which were portable and had higher resolution LCD screens. Meanwhile, Windows PC manufacturers could offer desktop configurations with LCD flat panel monitors at prices comparable to the eMac and at much lower cost than the iMac G4.[154] The flop of the Power Mac G4 Cube, along with the more expensive iMac G4 and heavy eMac, meant that Macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous iMac G3. For the next half-decade while Macintosh sales held steady, it would instead be the iPod portable music player and iTunes music download service that would drive Apple's sales growth.Statistics from late 2003 indicate that Apple had 2.06 percent of the desktop share in the United States that had increased to 2.88 percent by Q4 2004.[155] As of October 2006, research firms IDC and Gartner reported that Apple's market share in the U.S. had increased to about 6 percent.[156] Figures from December 2006, showing a market share around 6 percent (IDC) and 6.1 percent (Gartner) are based on a more than 30 percent increase in unit sale from 2005 to 2006. The installed base of Mac computers is hard to determine, with numbers ranging from 5% (estimated in 2009)[157] to 16% (estimated in 2005).[158]In recent years, market share of the personal computer market is measured by browser hits, sales and installed base. If using the browser metric, Mac market share increased substantially in 2007.[159] Mac OS X's share of the OS market increased from 7.31% in December 2007 to 9.63% in December 2008, which is a 32% increase in market share during 2008, compared with a 22% increase during 2007.From 2001 to 2008, Mac sales increased continuously on an annual basis. Apple reported worldwide sales of 3.36 million Macs during the 2009 holiday season.[160] As of Mid-2011, the Macintosh continues to enjoy rapid market share increase in the US, growing from 7.3% of all computer shipments in 2010 to 9.3% in 2011.[161] According to IDC's quarterly PC tracker, globally, in 3rd quarter of 2014, Apple's PC market share increased 5.7 percent year over year, with record sales of 5.5 million units. Apple now sits in the number five spot, with a global market share of about 6% during 2014, behind Lenovo, HP, Dell and Acer.[162]By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%.[163] Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC.[164] Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true.[165] Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier.[166] Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries.[167] Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs's return and the company's subsequent reorganization.[168] Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, with 66% of all computers over $1,000.[169] Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.[170]The sales breakdown of the Macintosh have seen sales of desktop Macs stayed mostly constant while being surpassed by that of Mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably; seven out of ten Macs sold were laptops in 2009, a ratio projected to rise to three out of four by 2010.[171] The change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop iMac moving from affordable (iMac G3) to upscale (iMac G4) and subsequent releases are considered premium all-in-ones. By contrast the MSRP of the MacBook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a Mac, with the exception of the even more inexpensive Mac Mini (the only sub-$1000 offering from Apple, albeit without a monitor and keyboard), not surprisingly the MacBooks are the top-selling form factors of the Macintosh platform today.[172] The use of Intel microprocessors has helped Macs more directly compete with their Windows counterparts on price and performance, and by the 2010s Apple was receiving Intel's latest CPUs first before other PC manufacturers.[173][174][175]In recent years, Apple has seen a significant boost in sales of Macs.[176] This has been attributed, in part, to the success of the iPod and the iPhone, a halo effect whereby satisfied iPod or iPhone owners purchase more Apple products, and Apple has since capitalized on that with the iCloud cloud service that allows users to seamlessly sync data between these devices and Macs.[177] Nonetheless, like other personal computer manufacturers, the Macintosh lines have been hurt by consumer trend towards smartphones and tablet computers (particularly Apple's own iPhone and iPad, respectively) as the computing devices of choice among consumers.[178]Although the PC market declined, Apple still managed to ship 2.8 million MacBooks in Q2 2012 (the majority of which are the MacBook Air) compared to 500,000 total Ultrabooks,[179][180] although there were dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11-inch and 13-inch models of the MacBook Air.[181] The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States.[182] While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to \"OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction\".[183] The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years.[173][174] Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, although being one of the higher-priced competitors,[184] though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air.[182] The competitive pricing of MacBooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks, as this contradicted the established \"elitist aura\" perception that Apple products cost more but were higher quality, which made these most expensive Ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were.[185]Apple has generally dominated the premium PC market, having a 91 percent market share for PCs priced at more than $1,000 in 2009, according to NPD.[186] The Macintosh took 45 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, compared to 13 percent for Dell, seven percent for Hewlett Packard, six percent for Lenovo and Asus, and one percent for Acer.[171][187] While sales of the Macintosh have largely held steady, in comparison to Apple's sales of the iPhone and iPad which increased significantly during the 2010s, Macintosh computers still enjoy high margins on a per unit basis, with the majority being their MacBooks that are focused on the ultraportable niche that is the most profitable and only growing segment of PCs.[171] It also helped that the Macintosh lineup is simple, updated on a yearly schedule, and consistent across both Apple retail stores, and authorized resellers where they have a special \"store within a store\" section to distinguish them from Windows PCs. In contrast, Windows PC manufacturers generally have a wide range of offerings, selling only a portion through retail with a full selection on the web, and often with limited-time or region-specific models. The Macintosh ranked third on the \"list of intended brands for desktop purchases\" for the 2011 holiday season, then moved up to second in 2012 by displacing Hewlett Packard, and in 2013 took the top spot ahead of Dell.[188]"

        "name": "iPad",
        "text": "iPad (/ˈaɪpæd/ EYE-pad) is a line of tablet computers designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc., which run the iOS and iPadOS mobile operating systems. The first iPad was released on April 3, 2010; the most recent iPad models are the seventh-generation iPad, released on September 25, 2019; the fifth-generation iPad mini, released on March 18, 2019; the third-generation iPad Air, released on March 18, 2019; and the 11-inch (280 mm) and third-generation 12.9-inch (330 mm) iPad Pro, released on November 7, 2018.As of May 2017, Apple has sold more than 360 million iPads,[6] though sales peaked in 2013.[17][18] It is the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2018.[19]The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. All iPads can connect via Wi-Fi; some models also have cellular connectivity. iPads can shoot video, take photos, play music, and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing. Other functions – games, reference, GPS navigation, social networking, etc. – can be enabled by downloading and installing apps. As of March 2016, the App Store has more than  million apps for the iPad by Apple and third parties.There have been nine versions of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness for the first time since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price. In 2018, Apple released a 2018 model of iPad with Apple A10 Fusion processor and Apple Pencil support. A year later, the 2019 iPad Air is released, with 10.5-inch display and Apple A12 chip.There have been five versions of the iPad Mini, all of which have a screen size of 7.9 inches (20 cm). The first generation has similar internal specifications to the iPad 2 but uses the Lightning connector instead. The iPad Mini 2 added the Retina Display, the Apple A7 processor, and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, closely matching the internal specifications of the iPad Air. The iPad Mini 3 added the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The iPad Mini 4 features the Apple A8 and the Apple M8 motion coprocessor. The 5th generation features the Apple A12 SoC.There have been three generations of the iPad Pro. The first generation came with 9.7\" and 12.9\" screen sizes, while the second came with 10.5\" and 12.9\" sizes, and the third with 11\" and 12.9\" sizes. The iPad Pros have unique features such as the Smart Connector, which are exclusive to this series of iPads.Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said in a 1983 speech[20] that the company's strategy was simple: \"What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes ... and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don't have to hook up to anything and you're in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.\"Apple's first tablet computer was the Newton MessagePad 100,[21][22] introduced in 1993, powered by an ARM6 processor core developed by ARM, a 1990 spinout of Acorn Computers in which Apple invested. Apple also developed a prototype PowerBook Duo based tablet, the PenLite, but decided not to sell it in order to avoid hurting MessagePad sales.[23] Apple released several more Newton-based PDAs; the final one, the MessagePad 2100, was discontinued in 1998.Apple re-entered the mobile-computing markets in 2007 with the iPhone. Smaller than the iPad, but featuring a camera and mobile phone, it pioneered the multi-touch finger-sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple's iOS mobile operating system. By late 2009, the iPad's release had been rumored for several years. Such speculation mostly talked about \"Apple's tablet\"; specific names included iTablet and iSlate.[24] The iPad was announced on January 27, 2010, by Steve Jobs at an Apple press conference at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.[25][26]Jobs later said that Apple had begun developing the iPad before the iPhone.[27][28] Jonathan Ive in 1991 had created an industrial design for a stylus-based tablet, the Macintosh Folio, as his first project for Apple; by 2004 his studio at the company was participating in the development of a large tablet prototype, which he later described as \"very crude, involving projectors\". Ive stated that after seeking to produce the tablet first, he came to agree with Jobs that the phone was more important,[29] as the tablet's innovations would work as well in it.[30] The iPad's internal codename was K48, which was revealed in the court case surrounding leaking of iPad information before launch.[31]Apple began taking pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010.[2] The only major change to the device between its announcement and being available to pre-order was the change of the behavior of the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable).[32] The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010.[2][33] The Wi-Fi + 3G version was released on April 30.[2][3][3] 3G service in the United States is provided by AT&T and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250 MB per month at half the price.[34][35] On June 2, 2010, AT&T announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2 GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan.[36] The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.[37]Initially, the iPad was only available to order at the Apple Store, but has since become available for purchase through retailers including Amazon, Walmart, and network operators. The iPad was launched in countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom on May 28.[38][39] Online pre-orders in those countries began on May 10.[3] Apple released the iPad in Hong Kong, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore on July 23, 2010.[40][41][42] Israel briefly prohibited importation of the iPad because of concerns that its Wi-Fi might interfere with other devices.[43] On September 17, 2010, the iPad was officially launched in China.[44]300,000 iPads were sold on their first day of availability.[45] By May 3, 2010, Apple had sold a million iPads;[46] this was in half the time it took Apple to sell the same number of first-generation iPhones.[47] After passing the one million mark they continued selling rapidly reaching 3 million sales after 80 days.[48] During the October 18, 2010, financial conference call, Steve Jobs announced that Apple had sold more iPads than Macs for the fiscal quarter.[49] In total, Apple sold more than 15 million first-generation iPads prior to the launch of the iPad 2[50] – selling more than all other tablet PCs combined since the iPad's release.[51] and reaching 75% of tablet PC sales at the end of 2010.[52]Jobs unveiled the iPad 2 at a press conference on March 2, 2011.[53][54] About 33% thinner than its predecessor and 15% lighter, the iPad 2 has a better processor, a dual core Apple A5 that Apple says is twice as fast as its predecessor for CPU operations and up to nine times as fast for GPU operations. The iPad 2 includes front and back cameras that support the FaceTime videophone application, as well as a three-axis gyroscope. It retained the original's 10‑hour battery life and had a similar pricing scheme.The successor to the iPad 2 was unveiled on March 7, 2012, by Apple CEO Tim Cook at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.[55][56] The new iPad contained a new dual core A5X processor with quad-core graphics, and a Retina Display with a resolution of 2,048 by 1,536 pixels,[57] more than 50 percent more pixels than a standard 1,920 by 1,080 high definition TV screen. A brief controversy erupted when it was revealed that the LTE advertised did not work in some countries.[58]On October 23, 2012, Apple announced the fourth generation iPad, which began shipping on November 2, 2012. The new hardware includes an A6X processor, HD FaceTime camera, improved LTE compatibility, and the all-digital Lightning connector. It is available in the same storage increments and pricing structure as the third generation.[59][60] Following the announcement of the fourth-generation iPad, the previous generation was discontinued.Alongside the launch of the fourth generation hardware, Apple announced the iPad Mini. With a screen measuring 7.9 inches, it is aimed at the emerging sector of smaller tablets such as the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7. The hardware of the new iPad Mini is similar to the iPad 2, with a 1,024 by 768 pixel resolution screen and a dual core A5 processor, but is 53% lighter and 7.2 mm thick. It was released on November 2, 2012, in 16 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB capacities and Wi-Fi or Wi‑Fi + Cellular versions.[60]On October 22, 2013, Apple introduced the fifth generation of iPad, called the iPad Air, and the second generation of iPad Mini, called iPad Mini 2 that comes with a Retina Display. The iPad Air went on sale on November 1, 2013, starting at $499, while the iPad Mini 2 was released on November 12, 2013, starting at $399.In the first quarter of 2014, Apple reported that it had sold 25 million iPads, an all-time quarterly record, compared to 22.9 million in the year-ago quarter.[61][62]In October 2014, Apple released the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3. The iPad Air 2 is the first iOS device to feature a triple core CPU and 2GB of RAM. As well as being thinner and faster than its predecessor, the iPad Air, it features Touch ID and is available with a gold color option. The iPad Mini 3 is similar than the iPad Mini 2 in design and hardware, but also includes Touch ID and available in gold color.In September 2015, the iPad Pro was announced, which included a 12.9-inch screen,[63] and a 9.7-inch version was announced in March 2016, with the addition of 256 GB option for both iPad Pro models.[64][65]On March 21, 2017, a new iPad was announced. The hardware includes an A9 processor and is designed to be a budget version of the iPad.[66]In June 2017, the iPad Pro's second generation hardware was announced to have 12.9 and 10.5-inch screens.[67]On March 28, 2018, the new iPad 9.7-inch 2018 model (6th generation) was announced. The new model uses the A10 Fusion processor and fully supports the Apple Pencil, it replaces the 2017 model.[68]On October 30, 2018, the third-generation iPad Pro was announced and was the first generation to support 1 TB of storage.On March 18, 2019, Apple announced the iPad Air (2019) and the 5th generation iPad Mini, both with A12 Bionic processors.[69]The iPad's (first two generations) touchscreen display is a 1,024 by 768 pixel, 7.75×5.82 in (197×148 mm) liquid-crystal display (diagonal 9.7 in (246.4 mm)), with fingerprint- and scratch-resistant glass. Steve Jobs said a 7-inch screen would be \"too small to express the software\" and that 10 inches was the minimum for a tablet screen.[70] Like the iPhone, the iPad is designed to be controlled by bare fingers; normal, non-conductive gloves and styli do not work,[71] although there are special gloves and capacitive styli designed for this use.[72][73]The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis accelerometer to sense iPad orientation and switch between portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic \"native\" orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.[74]There are four physical switches on the iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but the iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, with rotation lock now available in an onscreen menu.[75] In the iOS 4.3 update, released with the iPad 2, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.[13]The first generation iPad had no camera; the iPad 2 has a front VGA camera and a rear-facing 720p camera, both capable of still images (but these are only taken at a low quality 0.3 megapixels) and 30fps video. The rear-facing camera has a 5× digital zoom for still images only. Both shoot photo and video in a 4:3 fullscreen aspect ratio, unlike the iPhone 4, which shoots in a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio. Unlike the iPhone, the iPad does not support tap to focus, but does allow a tap to set auto exposure.[76] The cameras allow FaceTime video messaging with iPhone 4, fourth generation iPod Touch, and Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion Macs.[77]The iPad has two internal speakers reproducing left and right channel audio located on the bottom-right of the unit. In the original iPad, the speakers push sound through two small sealed channels leading to the three audio ports carved into the device,[14] while the iPad 2 has its speakers behind a single grill.[9] A volume switch is on the right side of the unit. A 3.5-mm TRRS connector audio-out jack on the top-left corner of the device provides stereo sound for headphones with or without microphones and/or volume controls. The iPad also contains a microphone that can be used for voice recording.The built-in Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR interface allows wireless headphones and keyboards to be used with the iPad.[78] However iOS does not currently support file transfer via Bluetooth.[79] iPad also features 1,024×768 VGA video output for limited applications,[80] screen capture,[81] connecting an external display or television through an accessory adapter.The iPad uses an internal rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology.[82] The iPad is designed to be charged with a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.[83]Apple claims that the battery for both generations of iPad can provide up to 10 hours of video, 140 hours of audio playback, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery technology, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time, but is not designed to be user-replaceable. In a program similar to the battery-replacement program for the iPod and the original iPhone, Apple will replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished iPad for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping.[84][85] As a different unit is supplied, user data is not preserved. The refurbished unit will have a new case.[86] The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.Independent companies also provide a battery replacement service, returning the original unit with new battery but original case. Alternatively it is possible for a technically competent user to buy and install a new battery. The task does not require soldering, but is technically challenging.[87]The iPad was released with three capacity options for storage: 16, 32, or 64 GB of internal flash memory. On January 29, 2013, Apple announced a 128 GB model of the fourth generation iPad, which was released on February 5.[12] All data is stored on the internal flash memory, with no option to expand storage. Apple sells a \"camera connection kit\" with an SD card reader, but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos.[88] On March 21, 2016, Apple announced a 256 GB model of the iPad Pro, which was released on March 31. In 2017, Apple released a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a revised 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a 512 GB option, the first of its kind on an iOS device. In 2018, Apple released a 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro, both with a 1 TB option.Apple iOS, in combination with their specific hardware, uses crypto-shredding when activating the \"Erase all content and settings\" by obliterating all the keys in 'effaceable storage'. This renders all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible.[89]iPad models come in two basic variants: Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi with cellular support. The cellular variants however do not support circuit-switched voice calls and texts, only data connectivity. The side of the Wi-Fi + 3G iPad had a micro-SIM slot (not mini-SIM). The 3G iPad can be used with any compatible GSM carrier, unlike the iPhone, which is usually sold 'locked' to specific carriers.[90] On the first generations of the iPad in the U.S., data network access via T-Mobile's network was limited to slower EDGE cellular speeds because T-Mobile's 3G Network at the time used different frequencies.[91][92]The second generation iPad introduced a third tier of models with CDMA support for Verizon Wireless in the United States, available separately from the AT&T capable version.[93]The iPad up to the 4th generation uses a Micro-SIM, while the first generation iPad Mini uses a nano-SIM as introduced with the iPhone 5. The iPad mini is available with two different frequency bands worldwide. Both devices support the same quad-band GSM and quad-band UMTS frequencies, but one variant also supports LTE bands 4 and 17 (principally intended for use on the U.S. AT&T network), while the other adds support for LTE bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25 and CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B.The 5th generation iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced support for many additional LTE bands worldwide. The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models come in two variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, penta-band UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and TD-LTE bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant which supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers at the time of the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).Apple offers several iPad accessories,[94] most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.[13] A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad,[95] but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter (\"wall charger\") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.Apple sells a camera connection kit that consists of two separate adapters for the dock connector, one to USB Type A, the other an SD card reader. Adapter can be used to transfer photos and videos and to plug USB audio card or MIDI keyboard.[96] A third party sells an adapter that includes USB, SD, and MicroSD on a single unit.[97] An adapter to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors. Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector.[98] While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.[99]Smart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to the face of the iPad 2, 3, or 4. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets.[100] While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad (which wakes up when the cover is removed). There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive. Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad.[101] In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case - a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices.[102]Like the iPhone, with which it shares a development environment[103] the iPad only runs its own software, software downloaded from Apple's App Store, and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices.[104][failed verification] The iPad runs almost all third-party iPhone applications, displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen.[105] Developers may also create or modify apps to take advantage of the iPad's features,[106] and there are one million apps optimized for the iPad, as of March 2016.[107] Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad.[108] The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2. On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010;[109] to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.[110]The interface is centred around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing an open application in the process.[111][failed verification]Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons, and the dock holds up to six icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using multi-touch. The iPad's interaction techniques enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"pinching\".Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.Other user-centered interactive effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.The layout of the music library is similar to an iPod or current[when?] Symbian S60 phones. The iPad can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow, likewise this feature may be disabled if purposely wishing to view a screen from another angle. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.The iPad supports gapless playback.[112] Like the fifth-generation iPods introduced in 2005, the iPad can play digital video, allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and fullscreen video playback.The iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.The iPad can use Wi-Fi network trilateration from Skyhook Wireless to provide location information to applications such as Google Maps. The 3G model supports A-GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; it also has a black strip on the back to aid 3G reception.[113] The iPad has a headphone jack and a proprietary Apple dock connector, but no Ethernet or USB port.[13] However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.The iPad comes with several applications, including Safari, Mail, Photos, Video, iPod, iTunes, App Store, iBooks, Maps, Notes, Calendar, and Contacts.[114] Several are improved versions of applications developed for the iPhone or Mac. The apps currently missing are the weather, calculator, and health apps.The iPad syncs with iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC.[25] Apple ported its iWork suite from the Mac to the iPad, and sells pared down versions of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps in the App Store.[115] Although the iPad is not designed to replace a mobile phone, a user can use a wired headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place telephone calls over Wi-Fi or 3G using a VoIP application.[116] As of June 2012, there were about 225,000 iPad specific apps on the App Store.[117][needs update]In December 2010, Reuters reported that iPhone and iPad users have lodged a lawsuit against Apple alleging that some applications were passing their information to third party advertisers without consent.[118]The iPad has an optional iBooks application that can be downloaded from the App Store, which displays books and other ePub-format content downloaded from the iBookstore.[119] For the iPad launch on April 3, 2010, the iBookstore is available only in the United States.[2][25] Several major book publishers including Penguin Books, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan have committed to publishing books for the iPad.[120] Despite its being a direct competitor to both the Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble Nook,[121] both Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble have made Kindle and Nook apps available for the iPad.[122][123]In February 2010, Condé Nast said it would sell iPad subscriptions for several of its magazines by June.[124]In April 2010, The New York Times announced that it would begin publishing daily on the iPad.[125] The \"Top News\" section is available free of charge, and the remainder on payment of a subscription.[126] Major news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal, the BBC, and Reuters have released iPad applications. NewsCorp created an iPad-only publication, The Daily, in February 2011.[127] It ceased operations in December 2012.[citation needed]16 GB re-released: October 16, 2014Touch ID (finger-print scanner in home button)The iPad is assembled by Foxconn, which also manufactures Apple's iPod, iPhone and Mac Mini, in its largest plant in Shenzhen, China,[163][164] and by Pegatron in Shanghai, China.[165][166] In April 2011, Foxconn announced that it would be moving production of the iPad and other Apple products to Brazil where it could begin production before the end of 2011.[167]iSuppli estimated that each first-generation iPad 16 GB Wi-Fi version costs US$259.60 to manufacture, a total that excludes research, development, licensing, royalty and patent costs.[168] Apple does not disclose the makers of iPad components, but teardown reports and analysis from industry insiders indicate that various parts and their suppliers include:Touch ID (finger-print scanner in home button)Wi-Fi + Cellular models:Wi-Fi + Cellular models:Wi-Fi + Cellular models:Wi-Fi + Cellular models:Wi-Fi + Cellular models:Wi-Fi + Cellular models:Fully laminated display, Antireflective coatingFully laminated display, Antireflective coatingFully laminated display, Antireflective coating, ProMotion display (120 Hertz refresh rate)Fully laminated display, Antireflective coating, ProMotion display (120 Hertz refresh rate)Fully laminated display, Antireflective coating, ProMotion display (120 Hertz refresh rate)Fully laminated display, Antireflective coating, ProMotion display (120 Hertz refresh rate)Backside illumination, Face Detection, Exposure control, Panorama (up to 43 MP), Burst mode, Tap to focus, Photo geotagging, Timer mode, Video Recording, 1080p video recording (30 fps), Slo-mo video support for 720p at 120 fps, Time-lapse video, Video image stabilization, 3× digital zoom, Video geotaggingPhoto and video geotagging, Timer mode, Video Recording, Cinematic video stabilization, 4K video recording (30 fps), 1080p HD video recording at 30fps or 60fps, Slo-mo video support for 1080p at 120 fps and 720p at 240 fps, Time-lapse video, 3× digital zoom, True Tone LED flash, Sapphire crystal lens cover, improved local tone mapping, improved noise reductionBluetooth 4.2 technologyBluetooth 5.0 technologyUMTS/HSPA/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz), CDMA EV-DO Rev.

Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a non-disclosure agreement and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process and control of the platform itself could stifle software innovation. Of particular concern to digital rights advocates is Apple's ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time.[204][205][206]Digital rights advocates, including the Free Software Foundation,[207] Electronic Frontier Foundation,[206] and computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle,[citation needed] have criticized the iPad for its digital rights restrictions. In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, an analyst with GigaOM, was quoted by National Public Radio as saying, \"With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet in your hands. ... It offers [the major media companies] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you.\" But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart the feeling of a safe neighborhood, saying, \"Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too.\" Laura Sydell, the article's author, concludes, \"As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community.\"[208] The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns.[209]Like certain iOS devices, the iPad can be \"jailbroken\", depending on which version of iOS it is running, thus allowing applications and programs that are not authorized by Apple to run on the device.[210][211] Once it is jailbroken, users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through the App Store via unofficial installers such as Cydia, as well as illegally pirated applications.[211] Apple claims jailbreaking \"can\" void the factory warranty on the device in the United States even though jailbreaking is legal.[211][212] The iPad, released in April 2010, was first jailbroken in May 2010 with the Spirit jailbreak for iOS version 3.1.2.[213] The iPad can be jailbroken on iOS versions 4.3 through 4.3.3 with the web-based tool JailbreakMe 3.0 (released in July 2011),[214] and on iOS versions including 5.0 and 5.0.1 using redsn0w[215] Absinthe 2.0 was released on May 25, 2012 as the first jailbreak method for all iOS 5.1.1 devices except the 32 nm version of the iPad 2.[216]Apple's App Store, which provides iPhone and iPad applications, imposes censorship of content, which has become an issue for book publishers and magazines seeking to use the platform. The Guardian newspaper described the role of Apple as analogous to that of British magazine distributor WH Smith, which for many years imposed content restrictions.[217]Due to the exclusion of pornography from the App Store, YouPorn and others changed their video format from Flash to H.264 and HTML5 specifically for the iPad.[218] In an e-mail exchange[219] with Ryan Tate from Valleywag, Steve Jobs claimed that the iPad offers \"freedom from porn\", leading to many upset replies including Adbustings in Berlin by artist Johannes P. Osterhoff[220] and in San Francisco during WWDC10.[221]On May 28, 2010, the iPad was released in Australia, Canada, and Japan, as well as in several larger European countries. Media reaction to the launch was mixed. The media noted the positive response from fans of the device, with thousands of people queued on the first day of sale in a number of these countries.[222][223]Media reaction to the iPad announcement was mixed. Walter Mossberg wrote, \"It's about the software, stupid\", meaning hardware features and build are less important to the iPad's success than software and user interface, his first impressions of which were largely positive. Mossberg also called the price \"modest\" for a device of its capabilities, and praised the ten-hour battery life.[224] Others, including PC Advisor and the Sydney Morning Herald, wrote that the iPad would also compete with proliferating netbooks, most of which use Microsoft Windows.[225][226] The base model's $499 price was lower than pre-release estimates by the tech press, Wall Street analysts, and Apple's competitors, all of whom were expecting a much higher entry price point.[227][228][229]CNET also criticized the iPad for its apparent lack of wireless sync which other portable devices such as Microsoft's Zune have had for a number of years. The built-in iTunes app is able to download from the Internet as well.[230]Reviews of the iPad have been generally favorable. Walt Mossberg then, of The Wall Street Journal called it a \"pretty close\" laptop killer.[231] David Pogue of The New York Times wrote a \"dual\" review, one part for technology-minded people, and the other part for non-technology-minded people. In the former section, he notes that a laptop offers more features for a cheaper price than the iPad. In his review for the latter audience, however, he claims that if his readers like the concept of the device and can understand what its intended uses are, then they will enjoy using the device.[232] PC Magazine's Tim Gideon wrote, \"you have yourself a winner\" that \"will undoubtedly be a driving force in shaping the emerging tablet landscape.\"[233] Michael Arrington of TechCrunch said, \"the iPad beats even my most optimistic expectations. This is a new category of device. But it also will replace laptops for many people.\"[234] PC World criticized the iPad's file sharing and printing abilities,[235] and Ars Technica said sharing files with a computer is \"one of our least favorite parts of the iPad experience.\"[236]The media also praised the quantity of applications, as well as the bookstore and other media applications.[237][238] In contrast they criticized the iPad for being a closed system and mentioned that the iPad faces competition from Android-based tablets,[222] that outsold iPads in 2013, surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013,[239] and have overtaken iPad's installed base,[240] and has lost majority of web browsing to Android, by StatCounter estimates, in South America, Africa, most of Asia – many large countries there and in Eastern Europe.[241] The Independent criticized the iPad for not being as readable in bright light as paper but praised it for being able to store large quantities of books.[237] After its UK release, The Daily Telegraph said the iPad's lack of Adobe Flash support was \"annoying.\"[242]The iPad was selected by Time magazine as one of the 50 Best Inventions of the Year 2010,[243] while Popular Science chose it as the top gadget[244] behind the overall \"Best of What's New 2010\" winner Groasis Waterboxx.[245]iPad tablets still[when?] have a wide margin globally on second most used Android tablets. The market share, however, differs widely by regions; and the iPad has lost market share globally, every year since 2012 (when StatCounter started tracking tablets separately).[246]According to StatCounter statistics, that tracks web use and gives operating system/platform share based on it, the iPad has lost majority of use in South America to Android,[247][248] did also lose majority while gaining back in Asia[249] and in Africa has lost by a wide margin, where Android is up to 70%.[250]While the iPad is mostly used by consumers, it also has been taken up by business users.[251] Within 90 days of its release, the iPad managed to penetrate 50% of Fortune 100 companies.[252] Some companies are adopting iPads in their business offices by distributing or making available iPads to employees. Examples of uses in the workplace include attorneys responding to clients, medical professionals accessing health records during patient exams, and managers approving employee requests.[253][254][255]A survey by Frost & Sullivan shows that iPad usage in office workplaces is linked to the goals of increased employee productivity, reduced paperwork, and increased revenue. The research firm estimates that \"The mobile-office application market in North America may reach $6.85 billion in 2015, up from an estimated $1.76 billion [in 2010].\"[256]Since March 2011, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the iPad for in-cockpit use to cut down on the paper consumption in several airlines.[257] In 2011, Alaska Airlines became the first airline to replace pilots' paper manuals with iPads, weighing 0.68 kg (1.5 lb) compared to 11 kg (24 lb) for the printed flight manuals. It hopes to have fewer back and muscle injuries.[258] More than a dozen airlines have followed suit, including United, which has distributed 11,000 iPads to cockpits.[259] Also, many airlines now offer their inflight magazine as a downloadable application for the iPad.[260][261][262]The iPad has several uses in the classroom,[263] and has been praised as a valuable tool for homeschooling.[264][265] Soon after the iPad was released, it was reported that 81% of the top book apps were for children.[266] The iPad has also been called a revolutionary tool to help children with autism learn how to communicate and socialize more easily.[267]In the healthcare field, iPads and iPhones have been used to help hospitals manage their supply chain. For example, Novation, a healthcare contracting services company, developed VHA PriceLynx (based on the mobile application platform of business intelligence software vendor MicroStrategy), a business intelligence app to help health care organizations manage its purchasing procedures more efficiently and save money for hospitals. Guillermo Ramas of Novation states, \"Doctors won't walk around a hospital with a laptop. With an iPad it's perfect to walk around the hospital with as long as they have the information they need.\"[268]In 2013, Gianna Chien (aged 14) presented to more than 8,000 doctors at the Heart Rhythm Society meeting that the Apple iPad 2 can, in some cases, interfere with life-saving heart devices (pacemakers) because of the magnets inside.[269] The iPad User Guide advised pacemaker users to keep iPads at least 6 in (15 cm) away from the pacemaker.[270] A study in 2014 found that the iPad 2 could cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) in implantable cardioverter defibrillators.[271]In the United States, fans attending Super Bowl XLV, the first Super Bowl since the iPad was released, could use an official National Football League (NFL) app to navigate Cowboys Stadium.[272] In 2011, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the first NFL club to discontinue the use of paper copies of playbooks, and instead distributed all players their playbook and videos in electronic format via an iPad 2.[273]The iPad is able to support many music creation applications in addition to the iTunes music playback software. These include sound samplers, guitar and voice effects processors, sequencers for synthesized sounds and sampled loops, virtual synthesizers and drum machines, theremin-style and other touch responsive instruments, drum pads and many more. Gorillaz's 2010 album, The Fall, was created almost exclusively using the iPad by Damon Albarn while on tour with the band.[274] The music video for Luna Sea's 2012 single, \"Rouge\", was filmed entirely on an iPad.[275]The iPad has greatly increased social television use. Viewers can use the iPad as a convenient second networked computer (or \"second screen\") for communicating with other viewers or with the television provider. Viewers can use a web browser or specialized applications to discuss a program with other viewers, while it is being broadcast, while content providers may use the second screen to interact with viewers in real time. For example, the latter facility allows content providers to conduct real-time polls or to collect comments about the program, that can be displayed as text on the main television screen. Viewer interaction via a second screen is becoming increasingly popular.[276]"

        "name": "iPhone",
        "text": "GSM models also include:CDMA model also includes:The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. All generations of the iPhone use Apple's iOS mobile operating system software. The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks. An iPhone can take photos, play music, send and receive email, browse the web, send and receive text messages, record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive visual voicemail. Shooting video also became a standard feature with the iPhone 3GS. Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading mobile apps. As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications available for the iPhone.Apple has released twelve generations of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the twelve major releases of the iOS operating system. The first-generation iPhone was a GSM phone and established design precedents, such as a button placement that has persisted throughout all releases and a screen size maintained for the next four iterations. The iPhone 3G added 3G network support, and was followed by the iPhone 3GS with improved hardware, the iPhone 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the iPhone 4S with improved hardware and the voice assistant Siri. The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector. In 2013, Apple released the iPhone 5S with improved hardware and a fingerprint reader, and the lower-cost iPhone 5C, a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal. They were followed by the larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with models featuring 4.7-and-5.5-inch (120 and 140 mm) displays. The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs, as well as the iPhone SE—which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The iPhone X was released alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID, but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID. In September 2018, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are the iPhone XS, an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, iPhone XS Max, a larger variant with the series' biggest display as of 2018 and iPhone XR, a lower end version of the iPhone X.The first-generation iPhone was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. Subsequent iterations of the iPhone have also garnered praise. The iPhone is one of the most widely used smartphones in the world, and its success has been credited with helping Apple become one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.As of November 1, 2018, a total of more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.[1]Development of what was to become the iPhone began in 2004, when Apple started to gather a team of 1,000 employees (including Jonathan Ive, the designer behind the iMac and iPod)[15] to work on the highly confidential \"Project Purple.\"[16] Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet (which Apple eventually revisited in the form of the iPad) towards a phone.[17] Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (which became AT&T Mobility) at the time—at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty months.[18]According to Steve Jobs, the \"i\" word in \"iMac\" (and therefore \"iPod\", \"iPhone\" and \"iPad\") stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.[19][20]Apple rejected the \"design by committee\" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple's iPod nano.[21][22]Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house[23][24] and even paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G),[25] in exchange for four years of exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.[26]Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.[27] The two initial models, a 4 GB model priced at US$499 and an 8 GB model at US$599 (both requiring a two-year contract), went on sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at 6:00 pm local time, while hundreds of customers lined up outside the stores nationwide.[28] The passionate reaction to the launch of the iPhone resulted in sections of the media dubbing it the 'Jesus phone'.[29][30] Following this successful release in the US, the first generation iPhone was made available in the UK, France, and Germany in November 2007, and Ireland and Austria in the spring of 2008.On July 11, 2008, Apple released the iPhone 3G in twenty-two countries, including the original six.[31] Apple released the iPhone 3G in upwards of eighty countries and territories.[32] Apple announced the iPhone 3GS on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the US, Canada and major European countries on June 19. Many would-be users objected to the iPhone's cost,[33] and 40% of users had household incomes over US$100,000.[34]The back of the original first generation iPhone was made of aluminum with a black plastic accent. The iPhone 3G and 3GS feature a full plastic back to increase the strength of the GSM signal.[35] The iPhone 3G was available in an 8 GB black model, or a black or white option for the 16 GB model. The iPhone 3GS was available in both colors, regardless of storage capacity.The iPhone 4 has an aluminosilicate glass front and back with a stainless steel edge that serves as the antennas. It was at first available in black; the white version was announced, but not released until April 2011, 10 months later.Users of the iPhone 4 reported dropped/disconnected telephone calls when holding their phones in a certain way. This became known as antennagate.[36]On January 11, 2011, Verizon announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4. Verizon said it would be available for pre-order on February 3, with a release set for February 10.[37][38] In February 2011, the Verizon iPhone accounted for 4.5% of all iPhone ad impressions in the U.S. on Millennial Media's mobile ad network.[39]From 2007 to 2011, Apple spent $647 million on advertising for the iPhone in the US.[16]On Tuesday, September 27, Apple sent invitations for a press event to be held October 4, 2011, at 10:00 am at the Cupertino headquarters to announce details of the next generation iPhone, which turned out to be iPhone 4S. Over 1 million 4S models were sold in the first 24 hours after its release in October 2011.[40] Due to large volumes of the iPhone being manufactured and its high selling price, Apple became the largest mobile handset vendor in the world by revenue, in 2011, surpassing long-time leader Nokia.[41] American carrier C Spire Wireless announced that it would be carrying the iPhone 4S on October 19, 2011.[42]In January 2012, Apple reported its best quarterly earnings ever, with 53% of its revenue coming from the sale of 37 million iPhones, at an average selling price of nearly $660. The average selling price has remained fairly constant for most of the phone's lifespan, hovering between $622 and $660.[43] The production price of the iPhone 4S was estimated by IHS iSuppli, in October 2011, to be $188, $207 and $245, for the 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB models, respectively.[44] Labor costs are estimated at between $12.50 and $30 per unit, with workers on the iPhone assembly line making $1.78 an hour.[45]In February 2012, ComScore reported that 12.4% of U.S. mobile subscribers used an iPhone.[46] Approximately 6.4 million iPhones are active in the U.S. alone.[34]On September 12, 2012, Apple announced the iPhone 5. It has a 4-inch display, up from its predecessors' 3.5-inch screen. The device comes with the same 326 pixels per inch found in the iPhone 4 and 4S. The iPhone 5 has the SoC A6 processor, the chip is 22% smaller than the iPhone 4S' A5 and is twice as fast, doubling the graphics performance of its predecessor. The device is 18% thinner than the iPhone 4S, measuring 7.6 millimetres (0.3 in), and is 20% lighter at 112 grams (4 oz).On July 6, 2013, it was reported that Apple was in talks with Korean mobile carrier SK Telecom to release the next generation iPhone with LTE Advanced technology.[47]On July 22, 2013, the company's suppliers said that Apple is testing out larger screens for the iPhone and iPad. \"Apple has asked for prototype smartphone screens larger than four inches and has also asked for screen designs for a new tablet device measuring slightly less than 13 inches diagonally, they said.\"[48]On September 10, 2013, Apple unveiled two new iPhone models during a highly anticipated press event in Cupertino. The iPhone 5C, a mid-range-priced version of the handset that is designed to increase accessibility due to its price is available in five colors (green, blue, yellow, pink, and white) and is made of plastic. The iPhone 5S comes in three colors (black, white, and gold) and the home button is replaced with a fingerprint scanner (Touch ID). Both phones shipped on September 20, 2013.[49]On September 9, 2014, Apple revealed the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus at an event in Cupertino. Both devices had a larger screen than their predecessor, at 4.7 and 5.5 inches respectively.[50]In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which added water and dust resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new dual-camera setup on the Plus model, new color options, and featured the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack from the iPhone.[51]On September 12, 2017, Apple officially unveiled the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which features a new glass design, camera improvements, a True Tone display, wireless charging and improved system performance. It also unveiled the iPhone X, which features a near bezel-less design, a facial recognition feature dubbed \"Face ID\" with facial tracking used for Animojis, an OLED screen with the highest pixel density on an iPhone, a new telephoto lens which works better in low light conditions, and improved cameras for AR.[52]On September 12, 2018, Apple officially unveiled the iPhone XS, XS Max[53] and XR[54] at the Steve Jobs theater at Apple Park. The XS and XS Max feature an improved Super Retina Display with Dolby Vision and HDR10 support with the XS Max featuring a larger 6.5\" display, improved cameras with Smart HDR, and the A12 Bionic chip. The iPhone XS and XS Max are IP68 water, liquid, and dust resistant which allow the devices to be submerged in up to 2 meters for a duration of 30 minutes, while iPhone XR retained the IP67 certification found in the first-generation iPhone X and also features an IPS LCD display instead of the OLED displays found in the higher end models. The iPhone XS/XS Max's IP68 certifications were tested using various liquids such as chlorinated-water, salt water, tea, wine, beer, and juices. Apple also announced the fourth generation of Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Series 4.On September 10, 2019, Apple officially unveiled the iPhone 11 at Steve Jobs Theater,[55][56][57] along with the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max.[58][59][57]Apple sold 6.1 million first generation iPhone units over five quarters.[60] Sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 temporarily surpassed those of Research In Motion's (RIM) BlackBerry sales of 5.2 million units, which briefly made Apple the third largest mobile phone manufacturer by revenue, after Nokia and Samsung[61] (however, some of this income is deferred[62]). Recorded sales grew steadily thereafter, and by the end of fiscal year 2010, a total of 73.5 million iPhones had been sold.[63]By 2010, the iPhone had a market share of barely 4% of all cell phones; however, Apple pulled in more than 50% of the total profit that global cellphone sales generated.[64] Apple sold 14.1 million iPhones in the third quarter of 2010, representing a 91% unit growth over the year-ago quarter, which was well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smartphone market in the September quarter. Apple's sales surpassed that of Research in Motion's 12.1 million BlackBerry units sold in their most recent quarter ended August 2010.[65] In the United States market alone for the third quarter of 2010, while there were 9.1 million Android-powered smartphones shipped for 43.6% of the market, Apple iOS was the number two phone operating system with 26.2% but the 5.5 million iPhones sold made it the most popular single device.[66]On March 2, 2011, at the iPad 2 launch event, Apple announced that they had sold 100 million iPhones worldwide.[67] As a result of the success of the iPhone sales volume and high selling price, headlined by the iPhone 4S, Apple became the largest mobile handset vendor in the world by revenue in 2011, surpassing long-time leader Nokia.[41] While the Samsung Galaxy S II proved more popular than the iPhone 4S in parts of Europe, the iPhone 4S was dominant in the United States.[68]In January 2012, Apple reported its best quarterly earnings ever, with 53% of its revenue coming from the sale of 37 million iPhones, at an average selling price of nearly $660. The average selling price has remained fairly constant for most of the phone's lifespan, hovering between $622 and $660.[43]For the eight largest phone manufacturers in Q1 2012, according to Horace Dediu at Asymco, Apple and Samsung combined to take 99% of industry profits (HTC took the remaining 1%, while RIM, LG, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, and Nokia all suffered losses), with Apple earning 73 cents out of every dollar earned by the phone makers. As the industry profits grew from $5.3 billion in the first quarter of 2010 to $14.4 billion in the first quarter of 2012 (quadruple the profits in 2007),[69][70] Apple had managed to increase its share of these profits. This is due to increasing carrier subsidies and the high selling prices of the iPhone, which had a negative effect on the wireless carriers (AT&T Mobility, Verizon, and Sprint) who have seen their EBITDA service margins drop as they sold an increasing number of iPhones.[71][72][73] By the quarter ended March 31, 2012, Apple's sales from the iPhone alone (at $22.7 billion) exceeded the total of Microsoft from all of its businesses ($17.4 billion).[74]In the fourth quarter of 2012, the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S were the best-selling handsets with sales of 27.4 million (13% of smartphones worldwide) and 17.4 million units, respectively, with the Samsung Galaxy S III in third with 15.4 million. According to Strategy Analytics' data, this was \"an impressive performance, given the iPhone portfolio's premium pricing\", adding that the Galaxy S III's global popularity \"appears to have peaked\" (the Galaxy S III was touted as an iPhone-killer by some in the press when it was released[75][76]). While Samsung has led in worldwide sales of smartphones, Apple's iPhone line has still managed to top Samsung's smartphone offerings in the United States,[77] with 21.4% share and 37.8% in that market, respectively. iOS grew 3.5% to a 37.8%, while Android slid 1.3% to fall to a 52.3% share.[78]The continued top popularity of the iPhone despite growing Android competition was also attributed to Apple being able to deliver iOS updates over the air, while Android updates are frequently impeded by carrier testing requirements and hardware tailoring, forcing consumers to purchase a new Android smartphone to get the latest version of that OS.[79] However, by 2013, Apple's market share had fallen to 13.1%, due to the surging popularity of the Android offerings.[80]Apple announced on September 1, 2013, that its iPhone trade-in program would be implemented at all of its 250 specialty stores in the US. For the program to become available, customers must have a valid contract and must purchase a new phone, rather than simply receive credit to be used at a later date. A significant part of the program's goal is to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple stores rather than carrier stores.[81]On September 20, 2013, the sales date of the iPhone 5S and 5C models, the longest ever queue was observed at the New York City flagship Apple store, in addition to prominent queues in San Francisco, and Canada; however, locations throughout the world were identified for the anticipation of corresponding consumers.[82] Apple also increased production of the gold-colored iPhone 5S by an additional one-third due to the particularly strong demand that emerged.[83] Apple had decided to introduce a gold model after finding that gold was seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers.[84]Apple released its opening weekend sales results for the 5C and 5S models, showing an all-time high for the product's sales figures, with nine million handsets sold—the previous record was set in 2012, when five million handsets were sold during the opening weekend of the 5 model. This was the first time that Apple has simultaneously launched two models and the inclusion of China in the list of markets contributed to the record sales result.[85] Apple also announced that, as of September 23, 2013, 200 million devices were running the iOS 7 update, making it the \"fastest software upgrade in history.\"[86]An Apple Store located at the Christiana Mall in Newark, Delaware, claimed the highest iPhones sales figures in November 2013. The store's high sales results are due to the absence of a sales tax in the state of Delaware.[87]The finalization of a deal between Apple and China Mobile, the world's largest mobile network, was announced in late December 2013. The multi-year agreement provides iPhone access to over 760 million China Mobile subscribers.[88]In the first quarter of 2014, Apple reported that it had sold 51 million iPhones, an all-time quarterly record, compared to 47.8 million in the year-ago quarter.[89][90]The iPhone Upgrade Program is a 24-month program designed for consumers to be able to get the latest iPhone every year, without paying the whole price up-front. The program consists of \"low monthly payments\", where consumers will gradually pay for the iPhone they have over a 24-month period, with an opportunity to switch (upgrade) to the new iPhone after 12 months of payment have passed. Once 12 months have passed, consumers can trade their current iPhone with a new one, and the payments are transferred from the old device to the new device, and the program \"restarts\" with a new 24-month period.[91]Additional features of the program include unlocked handsets, which means consumers are free to pick the network carrier they want, and two-year AppleCare+ protection, which includes \"hardware repairs, software support, and coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage\".[91][92]Criticism of the program includes the potential endless cycle of payments, with The Huffington Post's Damon Beres writing, \"Complete the full 24-month payment cycle, and you're stuck with an outdated phone. Upgrade every 12 months, and you'll never stop owing Apple money for iPhones\". Additionally, the program is limited to just the iPhone hardware; cell phone service from a network operator is not included.[93]Before the release of the iPhone, handset manufacturers such as Nokia and Motorola were enjoying record sales of cell phones based more on fashion and brand rather than technological innovation.[94] The smartphone market, dominated at the time by BlackBerry OS and Windows Mobile devices, was a \"staid, corporate-led smartphone paradigm\" focused on enterprise needs. Phones at the time were designed around carrier and business limits which were conservative with regards to bandwidth usage and battery life.[95][96] Phones were sold in a very large number of models, often segmented by marketing strategy, confusing customers and sapping engineering resources.[97][98] For example, phones marketed at business were often deliberately stripped of cameras or the ability to play music and games.[99] Apple's approach was to deliberately simplify its product line by offering just one model a year for all customers, while making it an expensive, high-end product.Apple's marketing, developing from the success of iPod campaigns, allowed the phone to become a mass-market product with many buyers on launch day. Some market research has found that, unusually for a technology product, iPhone users are disproportionately female.[100] Ars Technica noted in 2012 that Apple had avoided 'patronizing' marketing to female customers, a practice used (often to sell low-quality, high-priced products) by many of its competitors.[101]When then-CEO of Research in Motion Mike Lazaridis pried open an iPhone, his impression was of a Mac stuffed into a cellphone, as it used much more memory and processing power than the smartphones on the market at the time.[95][96] With its capacitive touchscreen and consumer-friendly design, the iPhone fundamentally changed the mobile industry, with Steve Jobs proclaiming in 2007, that the phone was not just a communication tool but a way of life.[102]The dominant mobile operating systems at the time such as Symbian, BlackBerry OS, and Windows Mobile were not designed to handle additional tasks beyond communication and basic functions. These operating systems never focused on applications and developers, and due to infighting among manufacturers as well as the complexity of developing on their low-memory hardware, they never developed a thriving ecosystem like Apple's App Store or Android's Google Play.[102][103] iPhone OS (renamed iOS in 2010) was designed as a robust OS with capabilities such as multitasking and graphics in order to meet future consumer demands.[99] Many services were provided by mobile carriers, who often extensively customized devices. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to base its OS on OS X had the unexpected benefit of allowing OS X developers to rapidly expand into iOS development.[104] Rival manufacturers have been forced to spend more on software and development costs to catch up to the iPhone. The iPhone's success has led to a decline in sales of high-end fashion phones and business-oriented smartphones such as Vertu and BlackBerry, as well as Nokia.[102][105] Nokia realised the limitations of its operating system Symbian and attempted to develop a more advanced system, Maemo, without success. It ultimately agreed to a technology-sharing deal and then a takeover from Microsoft.[106]Prior to the iPhone, \"Handsets were viewed largely as cheap, disposable lures, massively subsidized to snare subscribers and lock them into using the carriers' proprietary services.\" However, according to Wired, \"Apple retained complete control over the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the iPhone\", meaning that it and not the carrier would control the software updates, and by extension security patches. By contrast, Google has allowed carriers and OEMs to dictate the \"pace of upgrades and pre-load phones with their own software on top of Android\". As a result, many Android OEMs often lag months behind Google's release of the next iteration of Android; although Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed two years of operating system updates and a third addition year for security. However, Apple has supported older iterations of iPhones for over four years.[26]In December 2017, there were reports that Apple has been using a policy of slowing down the speed of its older iPhones when issuing operating system upgrades.[107] It has spurred allegations that the firm has been using this as a tactic to prompt users of older iPhones to buy newer models.[107]Up to the iPhone 4, all iPhone models, as well as other iOS devices were manufactured exclusively by Foxconn, based in Taiwan. In 2011, after Tim Cook became CEO of the company, Apple changed its outsourcing strategy, for the first time increasing its supply partners. The iPhone 4s in 2012 was the first model which was manufactured simultaneously by two stand-alone companies: Foxconn as well as Pegatron, also based in Taiwan. Although Foxconn is still responsible for the larger share of production, Pegatron's orders have been slowly increased, with the company being tasked with producing a part of the iPhone 5C line in 2013, and 30% of the iPhone 6 devices in 2014. The 6 Plus model is being produced solely by Foxconn.[108]The touchscreen on the first five generations is a 9 cm (3.5 in) liquid crystal display with scratch-resistant glass, while the one on the iPhone 5 is four inches.[8] The capacitive touchscreen is designed for a bare finger, or multiple fingers for multi-touch sensing. The screens on the first three generations have a resolution of 320×480 (HVGA) at 163 ppi; those on the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S have a resolution of 640×960 at 326 ppi; the 4-inch models, with 640×1136 at 326 ppi; the 4.7-inch models, with 750×1334 at 326 ppi; the 5.5-inch models, with 1080×1920 at 401 ppi; and the 5.8-inch model X, with 1125×2436 at 458 ppi. The initial models were using twisted-nematic (TN) LCDs. Starting with iPhone 4, the technology was changed to in-plane switching (IPS) LCDs. The iPhone 5 model's screen results in an aspect ratio of approximately 16:9. The iPhone X is the first iPhone to use an OLED display. It has a near bezel-less screen with a ≈19.5:9 aspect ratio.[109]The touch and gesture features of the iPhone are based on technology originally developed by FingerWorks.[110] Most gloves and styli prevent the necessary electrical conductivity;[111][112][113][114] although capacitive styli can be used with iPhone's finger-touch screen. The iPhone 3GS and later also feature a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating.[115]The iPhone has a minimal hardware user interface, with most models featuring five buttons. The only physical menu button is situated directly below the display, and is called the \"Home button\" because its primary function is to close the active app and navigates to the home screen of the interface. Earlier models included a rounded square, reminiscent of the shape of icons on the home screen, however, new models which include Apple's fingerprint recognition feature Touch ID (which use the Home button as the fingerprint sensor) have no symbol. The iPhone X and later don't have a Home button but instead Face ID, a facial recognition authentication method.[116]A multi-function sleep/wake button is located on the top of the device. It serves as the unit's power button, and also controls phone calls. When a call is received, pressing the sleep/wake button once silences the ringtone, and when pressed twice transfers the call to voicemail. Situated on the left spine are the volume adjustment controls. The iPhone 4 has two separate circular buttons to increase and decrease the volume; all earlier models house two switches under a single plastic panel, known as a rocker switch, which could reasonably be counted as either one or two buttons.Directly above the volume controls is a ring/silent switch that when engaged mutes telephone ringing, alert sounds from new & sent emails, text messages, and other push notifications, camera shutter sounds, Voice Memo sound effects, phone lock/unlock sounds, keyboard clicks, and spoken auto-corrections. This switch does not mute alarm sounds from the Clock application, and in some countries or regions it will not mute the camera shutter or Voice Memo sound effects.[117] All buttons except Home were made of plastic on the original first generation iPhone and metal on all later models. The touchscreen furnishes the remainder of the user interface.A software update in January 2008[118] allowed the first-generation iPhone to use cell tower and Wi-Fi network locations trilateration,[119] despite lacking GPS hardware. Since the iPhone 3G generation, the iPhone employs A-GPS operated by the United States. Since the iPhone 4S generation the device also supports the GLONASS global positioning system, which is operated by Russia. Since the iPhone 8 it supports Galileo.[120]The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, introduced in 2015, feature 3D Touch displays which allows the screen to recognize how hard it is being pressed using pressure sensitive multi-touch technology.[121] An example of how this technology was used is lightly pressing the screen to preview a photograph and pressing down to take it. All subsequent iPhones with the exception of the iPhone SE and iPhone XR[122] had this feature until 2019. 3D Touch was omitted on all 2019 iPhones in favor of haptic touch, which was previously featured on the iPhone XR. Haptic touch retains some of 3D Touch's features but is based on a long press instead of a hard press.iPhones feature a number of sensors, which are used to adjust the screen based on operating conditions, enable motion-controlled games, location-based services, unlock the phone, and authenticate purchases with Apple Pay, among many other things.A proximity sensor deactivates the display and touchscreen when the device is brought near the face during a call. This is done to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs from the user's face and ears.[123]An ambient light sensor adjusts the display brightness which saves battery power and prevents the screen from being too bright or too dark.[124]A 3-axis accelerometer senses the orientation of the phone and changes the screen accordingly, allowing the user to easily switch between portrait and landscape mode.[125] Photo browsing, web browsing, and music playing support both upright and left or right widescreen orientations.[126] Unlike the iPad, the iPhone does not rotate the screen when turned upside-down, with the Home button above the screen, unless the running program has been specifically designed to do so. The 3.0 update added landscape support for still other applications, such as email, and introduced shaking the unit as a form of input (generally for undo functionality).[127][128] The accelerometer can also be used to control third-party apps, notably games. It is also used for fitness tracking purposes, primarily as a pedometer. Starting with the iPhone 5S, this functionality was included in the M7 Motion coprocessor and subsequent revisions of the embedded chip.A magnetometer is built-in since the iPhone 3GS, which is used to measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the device. Sometimes certain devices or radio signals can interfere with the magnetometer requiring users to either move away from the interference or re-calibrate by moving the device in a figure-eight motion. Since the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone also features a Compass app, which was unique at time of release, showing a compass that points in the direction of the magnetic field.Beginning with the iPhone 4, Apple's smartphones also include a gyroscopic sensor, enhancing its perception of how it is moved.[129]Some previous iPhone models contained a chip capable of receiving radio signals;[130] however, Apple has the FM radio feature switched off because there was no antenna connected to the chip. Later iterations of the iPhone (starting with the iPhone 7), however, do not contain radio chips at all.[131] A campaign called \"Free Radio On My Phone\" was started to encourage cellphone manufacturers such as Apple to enable the radio on the phones they manufacture, reasons cited were that radio drains less power and is useful in an emergency such as the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire.[132]Until 2017, iPhone models starting from iPhone 5S (excluding the iPhone 5C) featured Apple's fingerprint recognition sensor. It is used for unlocking the device and authenticating Apple Pay purchases (since the iPhone 6) using Touch ID. It is located in the home button. Touch ID has been replaced by Face ID, starting with the iPhone X.Included on the iPhone 6 and later (excluding the iPhone SE), a barometer used to determine air pressure, and elevation from the device.[133]Starting with the iPhone X, a facial recognition sensor, named the TrueDepth camera system is featured. It is used for unlocking the device and for authenticating purchases using Face ID. It can also be used for Animojis and AR.On the bottom of the iPhone, there is a speaker to the left of the dock connector and a microphone to the right. There is an additional loudspeaker above the screen that serves as an earpiece during phone calls. The iPhone 4 includes an additional microphone at the top of the unit for noise cancellation, and switches the placement of the microphone and speaker on the base on the unit—the speaker is on the right.[134] Volume controls are located on the left side of all iPhone models and as a slider in the iPod application.The 3.5 mm TRRS connector for the headphones is located on the top left corner of the device for the first five generations (original through 4S), after which time it was moved to the bottom left corner.[135] The headphone socket on the first-generation iPhone is recessed into the casing, making it incompatible with most headsets without the use of an adapter.[136] Subsequent generations eliminated the problem by using a flush-mounted headphone socket. Cars equipped with an auxiliary jack allow handsfree use of the iPhone while driving as a substitute for Bluetooth. The iPhone 7 and later have no 3.5 mm headphone jack,[137] and instead headsets must connect to the iPhone by Bluetooth, use Apple's Lightning port (which has replaced the 3.5 mm headphone jack), or (for traditional headsets) use the Lightning to 3.5 mm headphone jack adapter, which is included with iPhone 7 up until iPhone X and plugs into the Lightning port.Apple's own headset has a multipurpose button near the microphone that can play or pause music, skip tracks, and answer or end phone calls without touching the iPhone. Some third-party headsets designed for the iPhone also include the microphone and control button.[138] The current headsets also provide volume controls, which are only compatible with more recent models.[139] A fourth ring in the audio jack carries this extra information.The built-in Bluetooth 2.x+EDR supports wireless earpieces and headphones, which requires the HSP profile. Stereo audio was added in the 3.0 update for hardware that supports A2DP.[127][128] While non-sanctioned third-party solutions exist, the iPhone does not officially support the OBEX file transfer protocol.[140] The lack of these profiles prevents iPhone users from exchanging multimedia files, such as pictures, music and videos, with other Bluetooth-enabled cell phones.Composite[141] or component[142] video at up to 576i and stereo audio can be output from the dock connector using an adapter sold by Apple. iPhone 4 also supports 1024×768 VGA output[143] without audio, and HDMI output,[144] with stereo audio, via dock adapters. The iPhone did not support voice recording until the 3.0 software update.[127][128]The iPhone features an internal rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Like an iPod, but unlike most other mobile phones at the time of its launch, the battery is not user-replaceable.[136][145] The iPhone can be charged when connected to a computer for syncing across the included USB to dock connector cable, similar to charging an iPod. Alternatively, a USB to AC adapter (or \"wall charger\", also included) can be connected to the cable to charge directly from an AC outlet. Some models of the iPhone support wireless charging.[146]Apple runs tests on preproduction units to determine battery life. Apple's website says that the battery life \"is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles\",[147] which is comparable to iPod batteries.The battery life of early models of the iPhone has been criticized by several technology journalists as insufficient and less than Apple's claims.[148][149][150][151] This is also reflected by a J. D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey, which gave the \"battery aspects\" of the iPhone 3G its lowest rating of two out of five stars.[152][153]If the battery malfunctions or dies prematurely, the phone can be returned to Apple and replaced for free while still under warranty.[154] The warranty lasts one year from purchase and can be extended to two years with AppleCare. The battery replacement service and its pricing was not made known to buyers until the day the product was launched;[155][156] it is similar to how Apple (and third parties) replace batteries for iPods. The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a consumer advocate group, has sent a complaint to Apple and AT&T over the fee that consumers have to pay to have the battery replaced.[155] Apple reduced the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement to $29.[157]Since July 2007, third-party battery replacement kits have been available[158] at a much lower price than Apple's own battery replacement program. These kits often include a small screwdriver and an instruction leaflet, but as with many newer iPod models the battery in the first generation iPhone has been soldered in. Therefore, a soldering iron is required to install the new battery. The iPhone 3G uses a different battery fitted with a connector that is easier to replace.[159] The iPhone X features a different battery, with two battery cells, and the adhesive pull tabs are adhered to the sides instead of folded over the top, therefore making repairs a little more difficult than before.[160]A patent filed by the corporation, published in late July 2013, revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.[161]On December 28, 2017, amidst many complaints about older iPhone models slowing down when new ones are released, Apple released a communication to its customers on its website, acknowledging the effect that old batteries have on the iPhone's performance.[157] The company offered $29 battery replacements as a solution.[162]The first-generation iPhone and iPhone 3G have a fixed-focus 2.0-megapixel camera on the back for digital photos. It has no optical zoom, flash or autofocus, and does not natively support video recording. Video recording is possible on the first-generation iPhone and iPhone 3G via a third-party app available on the App Store or through jailbreaking. iPhone OS 2.0 introduced geotagging for photos.The iPhone 3GS has a 3.2-megapixel camera with autofocus, auto white balance, and auto macro (up to 10 cm). Manufactured by OmniVision, the camera can also capture 640×480 (VGA resolution) video at 30 frames per second.[163] The video can be cropped on the iPhone and directly uploaded to YouTube or other services.The iPhone 4 introduced a 5.0-megapixel camera (2592×1936 pixels) that can record video at 720p resolution, considered high-definition. It also has a backside-illuminated sensor that can capture pictures in low light and an LED flash that can stay lit while recording video.[164] It is the first iPhone that can natively do high dynamic range photography.[165] The iPhone 4 also has a second camera on the front that can take VGA photos and record SD video. Saved recordings may be synced to the host computer, attached to email, or (where supported) sent by MMS.The iPhone 4S' camera can shoot 8-MP stills and 1080p video, can be accessed directly from the lock screen, and can be triggered using the volume-up button as a shutter trigger. The built-in gyroscope can stabilize the image while recording video.The iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S, running iOS 6 or later, can take panoramas using the built-in camera app,[166] and the iPhone 5 can also take still photos while recording video.[167]The camera on the iPhone 5 reportedly shows purple haze when the light source is just out of frame,[168] although Consumer Reports said it \"is no more prone to purple hazing on photos shot into a bright light source than its predecessor or than several Android phones with fine cameras...\"[169]On all five model generations, the phone can be configured to bring up the camera app by quickly pressing the home key twice.[170] On all iPhones running iOS 5, it can also be accessed from the lock screen directly.The iPhone 5S features True Tone Flash, which has two LED lights, white and amber, that will improve white balance and will be adjusted in 1,000 combinations. Its image sensor is now 15 percent larger than its previous model.The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include phase detection autofocus, while the 6 Plus has Optical Image Stabilization. Both models can shoot 1080p videos at 60 frames per second.With the release of iOS 8, the iPhone 4S and later models can now shoot time-lapse videos, with its capability to switch frame rates automatically as the recording increases its time.[171]The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are outfitted with a 12 megapixel camera, with 4K HD video capability. The front-facing camera is upgraded to 5 megapixels. The user may change the resolution between 4K and 1080p in Settings.The iPhone SE features the same 12 MP camera found on the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models, with the same 4K video capability, but its front camera only has 1.2 MP.The iPhone 7 features optical image stabilization on its rear camera, a feature that was previously exclusive to the Plus models, and the 7 Plus is the first iPhone to feature dual-lens cameras (both 12 MP). Both models have a 7 MP front-facing camera. The second camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is a telephoto lens, which enables 2× optical zoom and up to 10× digital zoom. The rear cameras on the 7 and 7 Plus both have a f/1.8 aperture.[137] It also has a new quad-LED True Tone flash, which is brighter compared to its predecessors.The iPhone 8 camera remains largely the same as its predecessor, but it features a larger sensor, and a newer color filter. The camera can also now record 4K at 60 and 24 frames per second, and slow-mo at 1080p in 240 frames per second. The new camera system also enables Portrait Lighting, which defines the light in a scene. It also features a quad-LED True Tone flash with 2× better light uniformity and Slow Sync.[172]The iPhone X camera is almost the same as the iPhone 8's camera, but the telephoto lens has an aperture of f/2.4 and optical image stabilization.[173] The front camera also has Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting, due to the new TrueDepth camera system.[174]The iPhone XS, XS Max and XR have an updated 12MP (1/2.55\") sensor size with a 1.4 μm pixel size. The XS series has telephoto lens, while the lower end XR has only one lens.The iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max introduced an ultrawide lens; the latter two became the first triple-camera iPhones. The 11 has a dual-lens setup, lacking the telephoto lens of the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. The front camera is now capable of recording video at 4K as a result of a new 12 MP sensor, and can also capture slow-motion footage.The iPhone was initially released with two options for internal storage size: 4 or 8 GB. On September 5, 2007, Apple discontinued the 4 GB models.[175] On February 5, 2008, Apple added a 16 GB model.[176]The iPhone 3G was available in 8 and 16 GB when it was released in 2008.[177]The iPhone 3GS came in 16 and 32 GB variants and remained available in 8 GB until September 2012, more than three years after its launch.[citation needed]The iPhone 4 was available in 16 and 32 GB variants, as well as an 8 GB variant to be sold alongside the iPhone 4S at a reduced price point.[citation needed] The iPhone 4S was available in three sizes: 16, 32, and 64 GB.[178]The iPhone 5 and 5S were available in the same three sizes as the iPhone 4S: 16, 32, and 64 GB.[179][180] The lower-cost iPhone 5C model was initially available in 16 and 32 GB models; an 8 GB model was added later.[citation needed]The iPhone 6 and 6S were available in three sizes at launch: 16, 64, and 128 GB.[citation needed] The iPhone SE was available in 16 and 64 GB variants at launch.[181]When the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were released, Apple changed the base model storage capacity from 16 to 32 GB. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have configurations of 32, 128, and 256 GB storage.[182] Apple doubled the storage on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in two configurations[when?] (32 and 128 GB), as well as the iPhone SE six months later.[citation needed]The iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X have changed their base model capacity again to 64GB, while retaining the 256GB storage option.[citation needed]The iPhone XS and XS Max introduced a 512GB storage option, in addition to the existing 64 and 256 GB options. The iPhone XR comes in three storage options: 64, 128, and 256GB.GSM models of the iPhone use a SIM card to identify themselves to the GSM network. The SIM sits in a tray, which is inserted into a slot at the top of the device. The SIM tray can be ejected with a paper clip or the \"SIM ejector tool\" (a simple piece of die-cut sheet metal) included with the iPhone 3G and 3GS in the United States and with all models elsewhere in the world.[183][184] Some iPhone models shipped with a SIM ejector tool which was fabricated from an alloy dubbed \"Liquidmetal\".[185] In most countries, the iPhone is usually sold with a SIM lock, which prevents the iPhone from being used on a different mobile network.[186]The GSM iPhone 4 features a MicroSIM card that is located in a slot on the right side of the device.[187]The CDMA model of the iPhone 4, just the same as any other CDMA-only cell phone, does not use a SIM card or have a SIM card slot.An iPhone 4S activated on a CDMA carrier, however, does have a SIM card slot but does not rely on a SIM card for activation on that CDMA network. A CDMA-activated iPhone 4S usually has a carrier-approved roaming SIM preloaded in its SIM slot at the time of purchase that is used for roaming on certain carrier-approved international GSM networks only. The SIM slot is locked to only use the roaming SIM card provided by the CDMA carrier.[188]In the case of Verizon, for example, one can request that the SIM slot be unlocked for international use by calling their support number and requesting an international unlock if their account has been in good standing for the past 60 days.[189] This method only unlocks the iPhone 4S for use on international carriers. An iPhone 4S that has been unlocked in this way will reject any non international SIM cards (AT&T Mobility or T-Mobile USA, for example).The iPhone 5 and later iPhones use nano-SIM in order to save space internally. The iPhone XS, XS Max and XR added eSIM support in addition to nano-SIM, therefore they support Dual SIM functionality.All iPhones (as well as many other devices by Apple) have a small disc at the bottom of the headphone jack that changes from white to red on contact with water; the iPhone 3G and later models also have a similar indicator at the bottom of the dock connector.[190] Because Apple warranties do not cover water damage, employees examine the indicators before approving warranty repair or replacement. However, with the adoption of water resistance as a feature of the iPhone, this practice is no longer in use by Apple.The iPhone's indicators are more exposed than those in some mobile phones from other manufacturers, which carry them in a more protected location, such as beneath the battery behind a battery cover. These indicators can be triggered during routine use, by an owner's sweat,[191] steam in a bathroom, and other light environmental moisture.[192] Criticism led Apple to change its water damage policy for iPhones and similar products, allowing customers to request further internal inspection of the phone to verify if internal liquid damage sensors were triggered.[193]All iPhone models include written documentation, and a dock connector to USB cable. The first generation and 3G iPhones also came with a cleaning cloth. The first generation iPhone includes a stereo headset (earbuds and a microphone) and a plastic dock to hold the unit upright while charging and syncing. The iPhone 3G includes a similar headset plus a SIM eject tool (the first generation model requires a paperclip). The iPhone 3GS includes the SIM eject tool and a revised headset, which adds volume buttons (not functional with previous iPhone versions).[139][194]The iPhone 3G and 3GS are compatible with the same dock, sold separately, but not the first generation model's dock.[195] All versions include a USB power adapter, or \"wall charger\", which allows the iPhone to charge from an AC outlet. The iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS sold in North America, Japan, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru[196][197] include an ultracompact USB power adapter.In September 2014, with the launch of the iPhone 6, Apple announced Apple Pay, a mobile payment system. The feature, aimed to \"revolutionize\" the way users pay, uses an NFC chip, Touch ID fingerprint scanner (Face ID on iPhone X and later), Apple's Wallet app, and a dedicated \"Secure Element\" chip for encrypted payment information to make purchases at participating stores, both physical and online.[198]All iPhone models have a haptic engine to vibrate when a notification or alert, incoming call, etc. iPhone models before iPhone 4S use eccentric rotating mass motor. The iPhone 4S uses a linear resonant actuator vibrator, which usually uses less power and creates a quieter vibration.[199] However, the iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S uses an eccentric rotating mass motor. It is unsure as to why Apple decided to switch back. However, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus uses a linear resonant actuator vibrator.iPhone 6S and after uses taptic engine for vibration and haptic feedback, which works similar to the eccentric rotating mass motor.[200]The iPhone runs an operating system known as iOS (formerly iPhone OS).[201] It is a variant of the Darwin operating system core found in macOS. Also included is the \"Core Animation\" software component from Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard. Together with the graphics hardware (and on the iPhone 3GS, OpenGL ES 2.0), it is responsible for the interface's motion graphics. The iPhone comes with a set of bundled applications developed by Apple,[202] and supports downloading third-party applications through the App Store.[203]Apple provides free[204] updates to the operating system for the iPhone either wirelessly or through iTunes.[205] Major new updates have historically accompanied new models.[206][207]The size of the operating system depends on version. While iOS 8 required over 4.5 GB, its successor required only 1.3 GB.[208]The interface is based around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. iPhone applications normally run one at a time. Starting with the iPhone 4, a primitive version of multitasking came into play. Users could double click the home button to select recently opened applications.[209] However, the apps never ran in the background. Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed by a hardware button below the screen on the iPhone 8 and earlier. iPhone X and later models require that you swipe up.The original iPhone contained the following apps: Messages (SMS and MMS messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps (Google Maps), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and iTunes (store). The App Store was introduced for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4. Compass, FaceTime and GameCenter were added in iOS 4 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, and the iPod application was split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as an updated version of Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources. YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application. iOS 8 added Health app. iOS 9 replaced Newsstand and Passbook with News and Wallet. iOS 10 introduces Home. iOS 11 added Files. iOS 12 introduces Measure, an app that uses AR technology to measure objects and things. It is available on devices with an A9 chip or newer.Docked at the base of the screen, four icons for Phone, Mail, Safari (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.[210] On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create \"Web Clips\", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.[118]Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. The dock holds up to four icons, and is located at the bottom section of the screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the first-generation iPhone, 3G, 4 and 4S; The iPhone 5, 5C, 5S, and SE hold up to twenty-four icons; while the iPhone 6 and later iPhone models support up to twenty-eight icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as Spotlight, to the left of the first home screen.[127][128]Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using multi-touch. The iPhone's interaction techniques enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"pinching\".Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object. Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a \"down\" control to move the view \"downwards\", on iOS the user pushes upwards, as if moving a \"plank of wood floating on the water\", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen.[211][212]Other user-centered interactive effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.The iPhone allows audio conferencing, call holding, call merging, caller ID, and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out, and fades back in when the call has ended.The proximity sensor shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches. The iPhone does not support video calling or videoconferencing on versions prior to the fourth generation, as there is only one camera on the opposite side of the screen.[213]The iPhone 4 supports video calling using either the front or back camera over Wi-Fi, a feature Apple calls FaceTime.[214] Voice control, introduced in the iPhone 3GS, allows users to say a contact's name or number and the iPhone will dial it.[215] The first two models only support voice dialing through third-party applications.[216]The iPhone includes a visual voicemail (in some countries)[217] feature allowing users to view a list of current voicemail messages on-screen without having to call into their voicemail. Unlike most other systems, messages can be listened to and deleted in a non-chronological order by choosing any message from an on-screen list.A music ringtone feature was introduced in the United States on September 5, 2007. Users can create custom ringtones from songs purchased from the iTunes Store for a small additional fee. The ringtones can be three to 30 seconds long from any part of a song, can fade in and out, pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, or loop continuously. All customizing can be done in iTunes,[218] or with Apple's GarageBand software 4.1.1 or later (available only on Mac OS X)[219] or third-party tools.[220]With the release of iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012, Apple added features that enable the user to have options to decline a phone call when a person is calling them. The user can reply with a message, or set a reminder to call them back at a later time.[221]The layout of the music library is similar to that of an iPod. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.[215]The iPhone supports gapless playback.[222] Like the fifth-generation iPods introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play digital video, allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and fullscreen video playback.The iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone. The feature originally required a Wi-Fi network, but since 2012, it can be used on a cellular data network.[223]The iPhone includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.Internet access is available when the iPhone is connected to a local area Wi-Fi or a wide area GSM or EDGE network, both second-generation (2G) wireless data standards. The iPhone 3G introduced support for third-generation UMTS and HSDPA 3.6,[224] the iPhone 4S introduced support for HSUPA networks (14.4 Mbit/s), and support for HSDPA 7.2 was introduced in the iPhone 3GS.[225] Networks accessible from iPhone models include 1xRTT (represented by a 1× on the status bar) and GPRS (shown as GPRS on the status bar), EDGE (shown as a capital E on the status bar), UMTS and EV-DO (shown as 3G), a faster version of UMTS and 4G (shown as a 4G symbol on the status bar), and LTE (shown as LTE on the status bar).[226] 5G Evolution is now supported on AT&T in areas where implemented and stylized as a larger 5G and reduced size capital E.[227] 5GE uses the 4x4 MIMO doubling the number of antennas, 256-QAM, and three-way carrier aggregation. True 5G has not been implemented into the iPhone as of 2019.AT&T introduced 3G in July 2004,[228] but as late as 2007, Steve Jobs stated that it was still not widespread enough in the US, and the chipsets not energy efficient enough, to be included in the iPhone.[112][229] Support for 802.1X, an authentication system commonly used by university and corporate Wi-Fi networks, was added in the 2.0 version update.[230]By default, the iPhone will ask to join newly discovered Wi-Fi networks and prompt for the password when required. Alternatively, it can join closed Wi-Fi networks manually.[231] The iPhone will automatically choose the strongest network, connecting to Wi-Fi instead of EDGE when it is available.[232] Similarly, the iPhone 3G and onwards prefer 3G to 2G, and Wi-Fi to either.[233]Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 3G (on the iPhone 3G onwards) can all be deactivated individually. Airplane mode disables all wireless connections at once, overriding other preferences. However, once in Airplane mode, one can explicitly enable Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth modes to join and continue to operate over one or both of those networks while the cellular network transceivers remain off.Safari is the iPhone's native web browser, and it displays pages similar to its Mac and Windows counterparts. Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and the device supports automatic zooming by pinching together or spreading apart fingertips on the screen, or by double-tapping text or images.[234][235] Safari does not allow file downloads except for predefined extensions.The iPhone does not support Flash, which was still popular when the iPhone was introduced.[236] Consequently, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority adjudicated that an advertisement claiming the iPhone could access \"all parts of the internet\" should be withdrawn in its current form, on grounds of false advertising. In a rare public letter in April 2010, Apple CEO Steve Jobs outlined the reasoning behind the absence of Flash on the iPhone (and iPad).[237] The iPhone supports SVG, CSS, HTML Canvas, and Bonjour.[238] Google Chrome was introduced to the iOS on June 26, 2012, and Opera mini is also available.The Maps application can access Google Maps in map, satellite, or hybrid form. It can also generate directions between two locations, while providing optional real-time traffic information. During the iPhone's announcement, Jobs demonstrated this feature by searching for nearby Starbucks locations and then placing a prank call to one with a single tap.[239][240] Support for walking directions, public transit, and street view was added in the version 2.2 software update, but no voice-guided navigation.[241]The iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 can orient the map with its digital compass.[242] Apple also developed a separate application to view YouTube videos on the iPhone, which streams videos after encoding them using the H.264 codec. Simple weather and stock quotes applications also tap into the Internet.iPhone users can and do access the Internet frequently, and in a variety of places. According to Google, in 2008, the iPhone generated 50 times more search requests than any other mobile handset.[243] According to Deutsche Telekom CEO René Obermann, \"The average Internet usage for an iPhone customer is more than 100 megabytes. This is 30 times the use for our average contract-based consumer customers.\"[244] Nielsen found that 98% of iPhone users use data services, and 88% use the internet.[34] In China, the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS were built and distributed without Wi-Fi.[245]With the introduction of the Verizon iPhone in January 2011, the issue of using internet while on the phone was brought to the public's attention. Under the two U.S. carriers, internet and phone could be used simultaneously on AT&T networks, whereas Verizon networks only support the use of each separately.[246]However, in 2014, Verizon announced that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus would allow simultaneous voice and data over its LTE Network.[247] T-Mobile and Sprint have enabled calls over Wi-Fi, with Verizon and AT&T soon doing the same.[248]For text input, the iPhone implements a virtual keyboard on the touchscreen. It has automatic spell checking and correction, predictive word capabilities, and a dynamic dictionary that learns new words. The keyboard can predict what word the user is typing and complete it, and correct for the accidental pressing of keys near the presumed desired key.[249]The keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in landscape mode, which is supported by only a limited number of applications. Touching a section of text for a brief time brings up a magnifying glass, allowing users to place the cursor in the middle of existing text. The virtual keyboard can accommodate 21 languages, including character recognition for Chinese.[250]Alternative characters with accents (for example, letters from the alphabets of other languages) and emoji can be typed from the keyboard by pressing the letter for two seconds and selecting the alternative character from the popup.[251] The 3.0 update brought support for cut, copy, or pasting text, as well as landscape keyboards in more applications.[127][128] On iPhone 4S and above, Siri allows dictation.Since iOS 8, third party keyboards, distributed through the App Store, are allowed. Previously, they were only available on jailbroken iPhones.[252]The iPhone also features an email program that supports HTML email, which enables the user to embed photos in an email message. PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint attachments to mail messages can be viewed on the phone.[253] Yahoo! offers a free push-email service for the iPhone. IMAP (although not Push-IMAP) and POP3 mail standards are also supported, including Microsoft Exchange[254] and Kerio Connect.[255]In the first versions of the iPhone firmware, this was accomplished by opening up IMAP on the Exchange server. Apple has also licensed Microsoft ActiveSync and supports the platform (including push email) with the release of iPhone 2.0 firmware.[256][257] The iPhone will sync email account settings over from Apple's own Mail application, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Entourage, or it can be manually configured on the device itself. The email program can access almost any IMAP or POP3 account.[258]Text messages are presented chronologically in a mailbox format similar to Mail, which places all text from recipients together with replies. Text messages are displayed in speech bubbles (similar to iChat) under each recipient's name. The iPhone has built-in support for email message forwarding, drafts, and direct internal camera-to-email picture sending. Support for multi-recipient SMS was added in the 1.1.3 software update.[259] Support for MMS was added in the 3.0 update, but not for the original first generation iPhone[127][128] and not in the U.S. until September 25, 2009.[260][261]At WWDC 2007 on June 11, 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone would support third-party web applications using Ajax that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface.[262] On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's \"Hot News\" weblog, announced that a software development kit (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008. The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March 6, 2008, at the Apple Town Hall facility.[263]It is a free download, with an Apple registration, that allows developers to develop native applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch, then test them in an \"iPhone simulator\". However, loading an application onto a real device is only possible after paying an Apple Developer Connection membership fee. Developers are free to set any price for their applications to be distributed through the App Store, of which they will receive a 70% share.[264]Developers can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any costs to release or distribute the application beyond the membership fee. The App Store was launched with the release of iOS 2.0, on July 11, 2008.[257] The update was free for iPhone users; owners of older iPod Touches were required to pay US$10 for it.[265]Once a developer has submitted an application to the App Store, Apple holds firm control over its distribution. Apple can halt the distribution of applications it deems inappropriate, for example, I Am Rich, a US$1000 program that simply demonstrated the wealth of its user.[266] Apple has been criticized for banning third-party applications that enable a functionality that Apple does not want the iPhone to have: In 2008, Apple rejected Podcaster, which allowed iPhone users to download podcasts directly to the iPhone claiming it duplicated the functionality of iTunes.[267] Apple has since released a software update that grants this capability.[241]NetShare, another rejected app, would have enabled users to tether their iPhone to a laptop or desktop, using its cellular network to load data for the computer.[268] Many carriers of the iPhone later globally allowed tethering before Apple officially supported it with the upgrade to the iOS 3.0, with AT&T Mobility being a relative latecomer in the United States.[269] In most cases, the carrier charges extra for tethering an iPhone.Before the SDK was released, third parties were permitted to design \"Web Apps\" that would run through Safari.[270] Unsigned native applications are also available for \"jailbroken\" phones.[271] The ability to install native applications onto the iPhone outside of the App Store is not supported by Apple, the stated reason being that such native applications could be broken by any software update, but Apple has stated it will not design software updates specifically to break native applications other than those that perform SIM unlocking.[272]As of October 2013, Apple has passed 60 billion app downloads.[273] As of September 2016, there have been over 140 billion app downloads from the App Store.[274]As of January 2017, the App Store has over 2.2 million apps for the iPhone.[275][276]The original iPhone has been described as \"revolutionary\",[277] a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry,[278][279][280][281] and has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011.[282] Newer iterations have also received praise, such as being called \"the best phone\".[283]The iPhone attracts users of all ages,[34] and besides consumer use, the iPhone has also been adopted for business purposes.[284]Starting with the iPhone 4S, Apple added an accessibility feature to optimize the function of the iPhone with hearing aids.[285] Apple released a program of Made for iPhone Hearing Aids.[286] These hearing aids deliver a power-efficient, high-quality digital audio experience and allow the user to manage the hearing aid right from the iPhone. Made for iPhone hearing aids also feature Live Listen. With Live Listen the iPhone acts as a remote microphone that sends sound to a Made for iPhone hearing aid. Live Listen can help the user hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone speaking across the room.[287]The Braille Displays for iOS program was announced by Apple coinciding with the release of the iPhone 3GS, iPad and iPod Touch (3rd Generation). This program added support for more than 50 Bluetooth wireless braille displays that work with iOS out of the box. The user only needs to pair the keyboard to the device to start using it to navigate the iOS device with VoiceOver without any additional software. iOS supports braille tables for more than 25 languages.[288]iPhone lets the user know when an alert is sent to the it, in a variety of notice methods. It delivers both visual and vibrating alerts for incoming phone and FaceTime calls, new text messages, new and sent mail, and calendar events. Users can set an LED light flash for incoming calls and alerts or have incoming calls display a photo of the caller. Users can choose from different vibration patterns or even create their own.[289]The iPhone can enlarge text to make it more accessible for vision-impaired users,[290] and can accommodate hearing-impaired users with closed captioning and external TTY devices.[291] The iPhone 3GS also features white on black mode, VoiceOver (a screen reader), and zooming for impaired vision, and mono audio for limited hearing in one ear.[292] Apple regularly publishes Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates which explicitly state compliance with the U.S. regulation \"Section 508\".[293]With the release of iOS 9 for all iPhones, users have the ability to choose between two different screen view options. The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view. When the iPhone is placed in a standard view setting, the icons are normal size and the text remains the same. With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger. This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.AssistiveTouch helps to adapt the Multi-Touch screen of an iOS device to a user's unique physical needs. This can be of great assistance to those who have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, one can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger. The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap. Gestures like rotate and shake are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a wheelchair.[289]Guided Access helps people with autism or other attention and sensory challenges stay focused on the task (or app) at hand. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button, and limit the amount of time spent in an app. The user can restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen.24 different iPhone models have been produced. The models in bold are current flagship devices:Apple has filed more than 200 patent applications related to the technology behind the iPhone.[295][296]LG Electronics claimed the design of the iPhone was copied from the LG Prada. Woo-Young Kwak, head of LG Mobile Handset R&D Center, said at a press conference: \"we consider that Apple copied Prada phone after the design was unveiled when it was presented in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006.\"[297] Conversely, the iPhone has also inspired its own share of high-tech clones.[298]On September 3, 1993, Infogear filed for the U.S. trademark \"I PHONE\"[299] and on March 20, 1996, applied for the trademark \"IPhone\".[300] \"I Phone\" was registered in March 1998,[299] and \"IPhone\" was registered in 1999.[300] Since then, the I PHONE mark had been abandoned.[299] Infogear trademarks cover \"communications terminals comprising computer hardware and software providing integrated telephone, data communications and personal computer functions\" (1993 filing),[299] and \"computer hardware and software for providing integrated telephone communication with computerized global information networks\" (1996 filing).[301]In 2000, Infogear filed an infringement claim against the owners of the iPhones.com domain name.[302] The owners of the iPhones.com domain name challenged the infringement claim in the Northern District Court of California. In June 2000, Cisco Systems acquired Infogear, including the iPhone trademark.[303] In September 2000, Cisco Systems settled with the owners of iPhones.com and allowed the owners to keep the iPhones.com domain name along with intellectual property rights to use any designation of the iPhones.com domain name for the sale of cellular phones, cellular phones with Internet access (WAP PHONES), handheld PDAs, storage devices, computer equipment (hardware/software), and digital cameras (hardware/software). The intellectual property rights were granted to the owners of the iPhones.com domain name by Cisco Systems in September 2000.In October 2002, Apple applied for the \"iPhone\" trademark in the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, and the European Union. A Canadian application followed in October 2004, and a New Zealand application in September 2006. As of October 2006, only the Singapore and Australian applications had been granted.In September 2006, a company called Ocean Telecom Services applied for an \"iPhone\" trademark in the United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong, following a filing in Trinidad and Tobago.[304] As the Ocean Telecom trademark applications use exactly the same wording as the New Zealand application of Apple, it is assumed that Ocean Telecom is applying on behalf of Apple.[305] The Canadian application was opposed in August 2005, by a Canadian company called Comwave who themselves applied for the trademark three months later. Comwave has been selling VoIP devices called iPhone since 2004.[303]Shortly after Steve Jobs' January 9, 2007 announcement that Apple would be selling a product called iPhone in June 2007, Cisco issued a statement that it had been negotiating trademark licensing with Apple and expected Apple to agree to the final documents that had been submitted the night before.[306] On January 10, 2007, Cisco announced it had filed a lawsuit against Apple over the infringement of the trademark iPhone, seeking an injunction in federal court to prohibit Apple from using the name.[307] In February 2007, Cisco claimed that the trademark lawsuit was a \"minor skirmish\" that was not about money, but about interoperability.[308]On February 2, 2007, Apple and Cisco announced that they had agreed to temporarily suspend litigation while they held settlement talks,[309] and subsequently announced on February 20, 2007, that they had reached an agreement. Both companies will be allowed to use the \"iPhone\" name[310] in exchange for \"exploring interoperability\" between their security, consumer, and business communications products.[311]On October 22, 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple for infringement of its GSM, UMTS and WLAN patents. Nokia alleges that Apple has been violating ten Nokia patents since the iPhone initial release.[312]In December 2010, Reuters reported that some iPhone and iPad users were suing Apple Inc. because some applications were passing user information to third-party advertisers without permission. Some makers of the applications such as Textplus4, Paper Toss, The Weather Channel, Dictionary.com, Talking Tom Cat and Pumpkin Maker have also been named as co-defendants in the lawsuit.[313]In August 2012, Apple won a smartphone patent lawsuit in the U.S. against Samsung, the world's largest maker of smartphones;[314] however, on December 6, 2016, SCOTUS reversed the decision that awarded nearly $400 million to Apple and returned the case to Federal Circuit court to define the appropriate legal standard to define \"article of manufacture\" because it is not the smartphone itself but could be just the case and screen to which the design patents relate.[315]In March 2013, an Apple patent for a wraparound display was revealed.[316]Around April 20, 2011, a hidden unencrypted file on the iPhone and other iOS devices was widely discussed in the media.[317][318] It was alleged that the file, labeled \"consolidated.db\", constantly stores the iPhone user's movement by approximating geographic locations calculated by triangulating nearby cell phone towers, a technology proven to be inaccurate at times.[319] The file was released with the June 2010 update of Apple iOS4 and may contain almost a year's worth of data. Previous versions of iOS stored similar information in a file called \"h-cells.plist\".[320]F-Secure discovered that the data is transmitted to Apple twice a day and postulate that Apple is using the information to construct their global location database similar to the ones constructed by Google and Skyhook through wardriving.[321] Nevertheless, unlike the Google \"Latitude\" application, which performs a similar task on Android phones, the file is not dependent upon signing a specific EULA or even the user's knowledge, but it is stated in the 15,200 word-long terms and conditions of the iPhone that \"Apple and [their] partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of [the user's] Apple computer or device\".[322]The file is also automatically copied onto the user's computer once synchronized with the iPhone. An open-source application named \"iPhoneTracker\", which turns the data stored in the file into a visual map, was made available to the public in April 2011.[323] While the file cannot be erased without jailbreaking the phone, it can be encrypted.[324]Apple gave an official response on their web site on April 27, 2011,[325] after questions were submitted by users, the Associated Press and others. Apple clarified that the data is a small portion of their crowd-sourced location database cache of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers which is downloaded from Apple into the iPhone for making location services faster than with only GPS, therefore the data does not represent the locations of the iPhone. The volume of data retained was an error. Apple issued an update for iOS (version 4.3.3, or 4.2.8 for the CDMA iPhone 4) which reduced the size of the cache, stopped it being backed up to iTunes, and erased it entirely whenever location services were turned off.[325] The upload to Apple can also be selectively disabled from \"System services\", \"Cell Network Search.\" Regardless, in July 2014, a report on state-owned China Central Television labeled the iPhone a \"national security concern.\"[326]The \"Frequent Locations\" feature found in \"Settings\" under \"Location Services\" stores commonly visited locations locally on the device.[327] This feature is said to help the accuracy of the GPS and Apple Maps since it can log information about the locations the user has frequently visited. However, this feature also keeps track of the number of times that the user has been to that location, the dates, and the exact times. Media outlets have publicized instructions on how this can be disabled for concerned users.[328]It was revealed as a part of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have access to the user data in iPhones, BlackBerrys, and Android phones, respectively. They can read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes.[329]According to an article in The New York Times titled \"Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A.\", Apple has developed a new encryption method for iOS 8, described as \"so deep that Apple could no longer comply with government warrants asking for customer information to be extracted from devices.\"[330]Throughout 2015, prosecutors in the United States argued for the U.S. government to be able to compel decryption of iPhone contents.[331][332][333][334] After the 2015 San Bernardino attack, the FBI recovered an iPhone 5C that was issued to one of the shooters by his employer, and iCloud backups of that phone from a month and a half before the shooting. (The shooters had destroyed their personal phones.) The U.S. government attempted to obtain a court order under the All Writs Act compelling Apple to produce an IPSW file that would allow investigators to brute force the device passcode.[335][336][337] Tim Cook responded on the company's website, outlining a need for encryption, arguing that if they produce a backdoor for one device, it would inevitably be used to compromise the privacy of other iPhone users.[338] On February 19, Apple communicated to journalists that the password for the Apple ID for the iPhone had been changed within a day of the government obtaining it, preventing Apple from producing a workaround that would only target older devices.[339] See FBI–Apple encryption dispute.The GrayKey, manufactured by Grayshift, can unlock iPhones, even if they are disabled.[340][341] As a countermeasure, Apple implemented USB Restricted Mode.[342]As of April 2016, Apple's privacy policy addresses requests from government agencies for access to customers' data: \"Apple has never worked with any government agency from any country to create a 'backdoor' in any of our products or services. We have also never allowed any government access to our servers. And we never will.\"[343] In 2015 the Electronic Frontier Foundation awarded Apple five out of five stars \"commend[ing] Apple for its strong stance regarding user rights, transparency, and privacy.\"[344]Apple iOS in combination with their specific hardware uses crypto-shredding when activating the \"Erase all content and settings\" by obliterating all the keys in 'effaceable storage'. This renderes all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible.[345]Apple tightly controls certain aspects of the iPhone. According to Jonathan Zittrain, the emergence of closed devices like the iPhone have made computing more proprietary than early versions of Microsoft Windows.[346]The hacker community has found many workarounds, most of which are disallowed by Apple and make it difficult or impossible to obtain warranty service.[347] \"Jailbreaking\" allows users to install apps not available on the App Store or modify basic functionality. SIM unlocking allows the iPhone to be used on a different carrier's network.[348] However, in the United States, Apple cannot void an iPhone's warranty unless it can show that a problem or component failure is linked to the installation or placement of an after-market item such as unauthorized applications, because of the Federal Trade Commission's Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975.[349]Users can set restrictions or parental controls[350] on apps that can be downloaded or used within the iPhone. The restrictions area requires a password.[351]The iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has also been activated as a phone with an authorized carrier. On July 3, 2007, Jon Lech Johansen reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked the iPhone's other features with a combination of custom software and modification of the iTunes binary. He published the software and offsets for others to use.[352]Unlike the first generation iPhone, the iPhone 3G must be activated in the store in most countries.[353] This makes the iPhone 3G more difficult, but not impossible, to hack. The need for in-store activation, as well as the huge number of first-generation iPhone and iPod Touch users upgrading to iPhone OS 2.0, caused a worldwide overload of Apple's servers on July 11, 2008, the day on which both the iPhone 3G and iPhone OS 2.0 updates as well as MobileMe were released. After the update, devices were required to connect to Apple's servers to authenticate it, causing many devices to be temporarily unusable.[354]Users on the O2 network in the United Kingdom, however, can buy the phone online and activate it via iTunes as with the previous model.[355] Even where not required, vendors usually offer activation for the buyer's convenience. In the US, Apple has begun to offer free shipping on both the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS (when available), reversing the in-store activation requirement. Best Buy and Walmart will also sell the iPhone.[356]The iPhone's operating system is designed to only run software that has an Apple-approved cryptographic signature. This restriction can be overcome by \"jailbreaking\" the phone,[357] which involves replacing the iPhone's firmware with a slightly modified version that does not enforce the signature check. Doing so may be a circumvention of Apple's technical protection measures.[358] Apple, in a statement to the United States Copyright Office in response to Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) lobbying for a DMCA exception for this kind of hacking, claimed that jailbreaking the iPhone would be copyright infringement due to the necessary modification of system software.[359] However, in 2010, Jailbreaking was declared officially legal in the United States by the DMCA.[360] Jailbroken iPhones may be susceptible to computer viruses, but few such incidents have been reported.[361][362]iOS and Android 2.3.3 'Gingerbread' may be set up to dual boot on a jailbroken iPhone with the help of OpeniBoot or iDroid.[363][364]In 2007, 2010, and 2011, developers released a series of tools called JailbreakMe that used security vulnerabilities in Mobile Safari rendering to jailbreak the device (which allows users to install any compatible software on the device instead of only App Store apps).[365][366][367] Each of these exploits were quickly fixed by iOS updates from Apple. Theoretically these flaws could have also been used for malicious purposes.[368]In July 2011, Apple released iOS 4.3.5 (4.2.10 for CDMA iPhone) to fix a security vulnerability with certificate validation.[369]Following the release of the iPhone 5S model, a group of German hackers called the Chaos Computer Club announced on September 21, 2013, that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using \"easy everyday means.\" The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image as verification. The spokesman for the group stated: \"We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token.\"[370][371]Most iPhones were and are still[citation needed] sold with a SIM lock, which restricts the use of the phone to one particular carrier, a common practice with subsidized GSM phones. Unlike most GSM phones, however, the phone cannot be officially unlocked by entering a code.[citation needed] The locked/unlocked state is maintained on Apple's servers[citation needed] per IMEI and is set when the iPhone is activated.[372][failed verification]While the iPhone was initially sold in the U.S. only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers have found methods to \"unlock\" the phone from a specific network.[373] Although AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon are the only authorized iPhone carriers in the United States[citation needed], unlocked iPhones can be used with other carriers.[374] For example, an unlocked iPhone may be used on the T-Mobile network in the U.S. but, while an unlocked iPhone is compatible with T-Mobile's voice network, it may not be able to make use of 3G functionality (i.e. no mobile web or e-mail, etc.).[375][failed verification] More than a quarter of the original first generation iPhones sold in the U.S. were not registered with AT&T. Apple speculates that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release.[33][376]On March 26, 2009, AT&T in the United States began selling the iPhone without a contract, though still SIM-locked to their network.[377] The up-front purchase price of such iPhone units is often twice as expensive as those bundled with contracts.[378]Outside of the United States, policies differ, especially in U.S. territories and insular areas like Guam; GTA Teleguam was the exclusive carrier for the iPhone since its introduction, as none of the four U.S. carriers (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon) have a presence in the area.[379] Since 2013, Docomo Pacific ended GTA's exclusivity starting with the iPhone 5.[380]Beginning April 8, 2012, AT&T began offering a factory SIM unlock option (which Apple calls a \"whitelisting\", allowing it to be used on any carrier the phone supports) for iPhone owners.[381]It has been reported that all of the Verizon 4G LTE phones come factory unlocked. After such discovery, Verizon announced that all of their 4G LTE phones, including iPhones, would remain unlocked. This is due to the regulations that the FCC has placed on the 700 MHz C-Block spectrum,[citation needed] which is used by Verizon.[382] Apple loses more money than it makes on repair services in the US.[383]In the United Kingdom, O2, EE, 3, Vodafone, and Tesco Mobile sell the device under subsidised contracts, or for use on pay as you go. They are locked to the network initially, though they can usually be unlocked either after a certain period of contract length has passed, or for a small fee (with the exception of the 3 network, which will unlock the device at any time for no charge).[384] However, all current versions of iPhone are available for purchase SIM-free from the Apple Store or Apple's Online Store, consequently, they are unlocked for use on any GSM network too.[385]All iPhones purchased for full retail price at an Apple Store or online at apple.com come unlocked which allows customer selection of carriers.iPhones sold in Canada purchased through mobile carries such as TELUS, Rogers, or Bell were locked to their respective networks and unlocking required visiting a carrier store and paying an unlocking fee. Third party methods to unlock iPhones existed but were highly unreliable and sometimes rendered phones unusable. However, in 2017 the CRTC abolished SIM-locking and required that all mobile devices sold after December 1, 2017 come unlocked.[386] The CRTC also mandated that carriers must offer unlocking services of existing devices for free to consumers, regardless of whether or not they had purchased the phone themselves.Three major carriers in Australia (Optus, Telstra and Vodafone)[387] offer legitimate unlocking, now at no cost for all iPhone devices, both current and prior models.Internationally, policies vary, but many carriers sell the iPhone unlocked for full retail price.[186]In 2003, four years before the iPhone was officially introduced, the trademark iFone was registered in Mexico by a communications systems and services company, iFone.[388] Apple tried to gain control over its brand name, but a Mexican court denied the request. The case began in 2009, when the Mexican firm sued Apple. The Supreme Court of Mexico upheld that iFone is the rightful owner and held that Apple iPhone is a trademark violation.[389]In Brazil, the brand IPHONE was registered in 2000 by the company then called Gradiente Eletrônica S.A., now IGB Eletrônica S.A. According to the filing, Gradiente foresaw the revolution in the convergence of voice and data over the Internet at the time.[390]In Brazil, the final battle over the brand name concluded in 2008. On December 18, 2012, IGB launched its own line of Android smartphones under the tradename to which it has exclusive rights in the local market.[390] In February 2013, the Brazilian Patent and Trademark Office (known as \"Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial\") issued a ruling that Gradiente Eletrônica, not Apple, owned the \"iPhone\" mark in Brazil. The \"iPhone\" term was registered by Gradiente in 2000, 7 years before Apple's release of its first iPhone. This decision came three months after Gradiente Eletrônica launched a lower-cost smartphone using the iPhone brand.[391]In June 2014, Apple won, for the second time, the right to use the brandname in Brazil. The court ruling determined that the Gradiente's registration does not own exclusive rights on the brand. Although Gradiente intended to appeal, with the decision Apple can use freely the brand without paying royalties to the Brazilian company.[392]In the Philippines, Solid Group launched the MyPhone brand in 2007. Stylized as \"my|phone\", Solid Broadband filed a trademark application of that brand. Apple later filed a trademark case at the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) against Solid Broadband's MyPhone for \"confusingly similar\" to the iPhone and that it may likely \"deceive\" or \"cause confusion\" among consumers.Apple lost the trademark battle to Solid Group in a 2015 decision made by IPO director Nathaniel Arevalo, who also reportedly said that it was unlikely that consumers would be confused between the \"iPhone\" and the \"MyPhone\". \"This is a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to, to the great prejudice of a local 'Pinoy Phone' merchant who has managed to obtain a significant foothold in the mobile phone market through the marketing and sale of innovative products under a very distinctive trademark\", Arevalo later added.[393][394]"

It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services.Apple Watch uses a wireless connection to an iPhone to perform functions such as calling and texting, and can independently connect to a Wi-Fi network for some tasks[20]. Series 3 and later LTE Apple Watches can independently connect to a mobile network, largely obviating the need for an iPhone after initial setup. First-generation and Series 1 and 2 Apple Watches require an iPhone 5 or later with iOS 10 or later; Series 3 and later LTE models require an iPhone 6 or later with iOS 11 or later.[21]The Apple Watch was released on April 24, 2015[22][23] and quickly became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.[24][25]The second generation of Apple Watches was released in two tiers in September 2016 — the Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2 — while the first generation was discontinued.[26][27]The Apple Watch Series 3 was released on September 22, 2017, when the Apple Watch Series 2 was discontinued.[28]The Apple Watch Series 4 was announced on September 12, 2018; Apple Watch Series 1 was discontinued.[29]The Apple Watch Series 5, announced on September 10, 2019, became available on September 20, 2019. Series 4 was discontinued. Apple Watch Series 3 now sells at a lower price-point.The goal of the Apple Watch was to complement an iPhone and add some new functions.[30] Kevin Lynch was hired by Apple to make wearable technology for the wrist. He said: \"People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much. People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that's a little more human, a little more in the moment when you’re with somebody?\"[30] Apple's development process was held under wraps until a Wired article revealed how some internal design decisions were made.[30]Rumors surrounded an Apple-developed wearable device back as far as 2011, which conceptualized the device as a variation of the iPod that would curve around the user's wrist, and feature Siri integration.[31] On February 10, 2013, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was beginning to develop an iOS-based smartwatch with a curved display.[32] On February 12, 2013, Bloomberg reported that Apple's smartwatch project was \"beyond the experimentation phase in its development\", and employed at least 100 designers.[33] In March 2013, reports indicated that Apple planned to release the device by the end of the year.[34] In July 2013, Financial Times reported that Apple had begun hiring more employees to work on the smartwatch, and that it was targeting a retail release in late 2014.[35]In April 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal that the company was planning to launch new kinds of products that year, but revealed no specifics.[36] In June 2014, Reuters reported that production was expected to begin in July for a release in October.[37]On September 9, 2014, during a press event where the iPhone 6 was also presented, the new product was introduced by Tim Cook as \"the next chapter in Apple's story\" with a video that focused on its design and the various combinations of bands and case styles that would be available to the consumers. After the video, the audience rose to a standing ovation as Tim Cook reappeared onstage wearing an Apple Watch. Cook said that Apple Watch was \"a precise timepiece, a new intimate way to communicate from your wrist, and a comprehensive health and fitness device.\"[38][39]In comparison to other Apple products and competing smartwatches, marketing of Apple Watch focused more on advertising the device as a fashion accessory; a 12-page advertising spread for Apple Watch in an issue of Vogue focused primarily on combinations of body and band styles, and downplayed its technological aspects.[40][41] Apple later focused upon its health and fitness-oriented features, competing against dedicated activity trackers,[42] and with watchOS 3, expanded on them with fitness tracking for wheelchair users, social sharing in the Activity app, and a Breathe app to encourage mindfulness.Pre-orders for the Apple Watch began on April 10, 2015, with the official release on April 24.[43] The device was not branded as \"iWatch\" (which would put it in line with its pre-existing product lines such as iPod, iPhone, and iPad) because the inventor decided \"Apple Watch\" made more visionary sense than \"iWatch,\" which would have followed previously-existing strategems; in the United States, the \"iWatch\" trademark is owned by OMG Electronics – who was crowdfunding a device under the same name, and is owned in the European Union by Irish firm Probendi.[44][45] In July 2015, Probendi sued Apple Inc. for trademark infringement, arguing that through keyword advertising on the Google search engine, it caused advertising for the Apple Watch to appear on search results pages when users searched for the trademarked term \"iWatch\".[46]Initially, the Apple Watch was not available at the Apple Store. Beginning on April 10, 2015, customers could make appointments for demonstrations and fitting, but the device was not in-stock for walk-in purchases and had to be reserved and ordered online. CNET felt that this distribution model was designed to prevent Apple Store locations from having long line-ups due to the high demand.[47][48] Selected Apple Watch models were available in limited quantities at luxury boutiques and authorized Apple resellers.[49] On June 4, 2015, Apple announced that it did plan to stock Apple Watch models at its retail locations.[48] On August 24, 2015, Best Buy announced that it would begin stocking Apple Watch at its retail stores by the end of September.[50] Both T-Mobile US and Sprint also announced plans to offer Apple Watch through its retail stores.[51]On September 9, 2015, Apple launched a new subset of Apple Watch in collaboration with Hermès. This collection, dubbed \"Apple Watch Hermès,\" comes in a stainless steel body with crafted leather bands in distinctive styles from Hermès.[52] The following year, Apple launched another subset of Apple Watches in collaboration with Nike dubbed \"Apple Watch Nike+\". Both subsets feature additional watch faces and bands exclusive to their branding, but otherwise function exactly like standard Apple Watches of their series.[53]Apple Watch went on sale in India on November 6, 2015.[54] The device also launched in Chile, the Philippines, Indonesia, and South Africa.[55][56]The Apple Watch is available in multiple variants, generally distinguished by the material, color, and size of the casing,[57] with special bands and watchfaces available for certain variants co-branded with Nike and Hermès, which are also sometimes accompanied by other unique extras, like stainless steel charging pucks, premium packaging, and exclusive color basic bands.[58][59][60][61]The Series 4 and Series 5 have been made available two sizes, 40 mm (1.6 in) and 44 mm (1.7 in), replacing the 38 mm (1.5 in) and 42 mm (1.7 in) sizes of the original, Series 2, and Series 3 models.[62][63] The design of the watch has not changed significantly since its release, so customizable bands and accessories are typically compatible with any Apple Watch of the same size, while 38 mm (1.5 in) straps also fit 40 mm (1.6 in) watches, and 42 mm (1.7 in) straps fit 44 mm (1.7 in) watches.[64] The casing of the watch includes a mechanism to enable the straps to be interchangeable.For input, the watch includes a \"digital crown\", which can be turned to scroll or zoom and pressed to return to the home screen, and a touchscreen that features Force Touch technology, which makes it pressure-sensitive and capable of distinguishing between a tap and a press.[14] The watch also has a side button which can be used to display recently used apps and access Apple Pay.[65] Apple rates the device's battery for 18 hours of mixed usage.[14][66] Apple Watch is charged by means of inductive charging, using a cable similar to the MagSafe cable from Apple's MacBook family of laptops.[22] If the watch's battery depletes to less than 10 percent, the user is alerted and offered to enable a \"power reserve\" mode, which allows the user to continue to read the time for an additional 72 hours. The watch then reverts to its original mode when recharged.[67]Apple did not explicitly market the first generation Apple Watch as being waterproof, stating that it can withstand splashes of water (such as rain and hand washing), but does not recommend submersion (IPX7). However, external testing by The Iconfactory and others revealed that Apple Watch can function when submerged in various conditions (such as swimming), although its touchscreen experiences \"erratic\" behavior when submerged.[68][69]Apple introduced a high level of water resistance with the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, and the device was explicitly advertised as being suitable for swimming and surfing.[70]The first-generation Apple Watch, colloquially referred to as Series 0, uses the single-core S1 system-on-chip. It does not have a built-in GPS chip, instead relying on a paired iPhone for location services. It uses a linear actuator called the \"Taptic Engine\" to provide haptic feedback when an alert or a notification is received, and is used for other purposes by certain apps.[14] The watch is equipped with a built-in heart rate sensor, which uses both infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes.[71] All versions of the first-generation Apple Watch have 8 GB of storage; the operating system allows the user to store up to 2 GB of music and 75 MB of photos. When the Apple Watch is paired with an iPhone, all music on that iPhone is also available to be controlled and accessed from the Apple Watch.[72] Software support for the first Apple Watch ended with watchOS 4.3.2The second generation has two tiers. The Series 1 has a variant of the Apple S2 processor with GPS removed known as the Apple S1P. It has a lower starting price than first generation watches.[73] The Series 2 has the dual-core Apple S2 processor, water resistance to 50 meters, a display twice as bright, and a GPS receiver.[73][70]The third generation of the Apple Watch features a faster processor, the dual-core S3, Bluetooth 4.2 vs 4.0 on older models, a built-in altimeter for measuring flights of stairs climbed, increased RAM size, and is available in a variant with LTE cellular connectivity. Siri is able to speak on Apple Watch Series 3 due to the increased processing speed of the Watch.[74] The Series 3 Apple Watch is explicitly not compatible with iPhone 5 devices, requiring users to have an iPhone 5S or later for the GPS-only model, or an iPhone 6 or later for the cellular-enabled model.The fourth generation of the Apple Watch[75] was revealed during the 2018 Apple Special Event held at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California. It features larger displays with thinner bezels and rounded corners, a slightly rounder, thinner chassis with a redesigned ceramic back, a new S4 64-bit dual-core processor capable of up to double the S3's performance, upgraded 16 GB storage, new options for watch face customization, and a new electrical heart sensor which works by measuring the potential difference between the wrist and a finger from the opposing hand into the S4 Module over 30 seconds. The ECG system has received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration, a first ever for a consumer device,[76] and is supported by the American Heart Association.[77] This device can also detect falls and will automatically contact emergency services unless the user cancels the outgoing call. The microphone was moved to the opposite side between the side button and the digital crown to improve call quality. Other changes include the digital crown incorporating haptic feedback with the Apple Haptic Engine and includes the new Apple-designed W3 wireless chip.The fifth generation of the Apple Watch was revealed during the 2019 Apple Special Event. It includes an always-on display with energy saving LTPO OLED screen and low-power screen driver capable of refresh rates as low as once per second. Additional new features include International Emergency Calling enabling emergency calls in over 150 countries, a more power-efficient S5 processor, improved ambient sensor, doubling of storage to 32 GB, and the addition of a magnetometer, enabling a compass function. It also brought back the \"Edition\" tier, with a ceramic model absent from the previous generation, and a new titanium model which comes in two colors: space black and white (original)[78].Apple Watch runs watchOS, whose interface is based around a home screen with circular app icons. The OS can be navigated using the touchscreen or the crown on the side of the watch.[14] During its debut, the first generation Apple Watch needed to be paired with an iPhone 5 or later running iOS 8.2 or later; this version of iOS introduced the Apple Watch app, which is used to advertise Apple Watch, pair Apple Watch with an iPhone, customize settings and loaded apps, and highlight compatible apps from the App Store.[14]The Apple Watch is capable of receiving notifications, messages, and phone calls via a paired iPhone.[14] \"Glances\" allowed users to swipe between pages containing widget-like displays of information; however, this feature was replaced by a new Control Center. watchOS also supports Handoff to send content from Apple Watch to an iOS or macOS device,[14] and act as a viewfinder for an iPhone camera,[65] Siri is also available for voice commands, and is capable of responding with voice prompts on the Series 3 watches.[14] Apple Watch also supports Apple Pay, and enables its use with older iPhone models that do not contain near-field communication (NFC) support.[14]Apple Watch's default apps are designed to interact with their iOS counterparts, such as Mail, Phone, Calendar, Messages, Maps, Music, Photos, Reminders, Remote (which can control iTunes and Apple TV), Stocks, and Wallet.[14] Using the Activity and Workout apps, a user can track their physical activity and send data back to the iPhone for use in its Health app and other HealthKit-enabled software.[14] With watchOS 3, Reminders, Home, Find My Friends, Heart Rate, and Breathe were added to the many stock apps.With the release of watchOS 4 and the Series 3 Apple Watch, iPhone 5 support was dropped, requiring users to use an iPhone 5s or later with iOS 11 or later to use watchOS 4. Apple Watches still running watchOS 3 or below remain compatible with the iPhone 5. Further, watchOS 5 will not support the first Generation (prior to Series 1) Apple Watch.[79]watchOS 1.0.1 featured performance improvements and support for additional emoji and languages,[80] and was released on May 29, 2015. At WWDC 2015, Tim Cook announced watchOS 2.0; described by CNET as a \"significant revamp\", it included a new software development kit that allows more direct access to the device's hardware, new watch faces, the ability to reply to an e-mail, and other features.[81] watchOS 2.0 was set to be released on September 16, 2015, but was delayed due to a bug fix taking longer than expected;[82] it was instead released on September 21, 2015.[83]watchOS 2.0 featured new features and more general improvements to Apple Watch. Following the software update, some users experienced issues with lag.[84]watchOS 3.0 was announced at WWDC 2016, with a priority on performance. Users are able to keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information. Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance-laden Glances, an updated Control Center, and new reply options on Messages. Several new watch faces have also been added, including Minnie Mouse, along with the ability to switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping. A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local emergency line and pull up the user's Medical ID. Another feature is Activity Sharing, which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another. A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day, with visuals and haptic feedback. watchOS 3.0 was released to developers on June 13, 2016 and was made available to the public on September 13, 2016.watchOS 3.1 was released to the public on October 24, and watchOS 3.2 was released near the end of March 2017.[85] Both updates added minor improvements and bug fixes.watchOS 4.0 was announced at WWDC 2017 on June 5, 2017, and released to the public on September 19. watchOS 4 features a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an entirely redesigned music app. It also introduces GymKit, a technology platform to connect workouts with cardio equipment.watchOS 4.3 was released on March 29, 2018. It introduced support for Nightstand mode in portrait orientation. It brought back the ability for music playing on the iPhone to be controlled using the Music app on the Apple Watch and also enabled control of playback and volume on Apple's HomePod. Other new features included a new charging animation and a new app loading animation. Activity data was added to the Siri watch face, and the battery complication more accurately reports battery life.WatchOS 5.0 was first shown to the public at the San Jose WWDC developer conference held by Apple. It introduced an instant watch-to-watch walkie-talkie mode, all-new Podcasts app, raise-wrist-to-speak Siri, customizable Control Center, and the ability to access the notification center and control center from apps. Other features included support for WebKit to view web pages, six new watch faces, and new workout running features.[86] It was released to the public on September 17, 2018.[87] On the newest release of watchOS beta the sleep feature was shown on screen, this would eliminate the need to use third-party apps.WatchOS 6.0 was released to the public on September 19, 2019. It introduced more native iOS apps such as voice memos, calculator, and a native WatchOS app store. WatchOS 6.0 also introduced new features such as the noise app that allows you to measure the sound around you in decibels, menstrual tracking, and new watch faces. Other features include Siri being able to tell you what music you're listening to, Activity Trends, and a new UI framework for developers.WatchOS supports third-party applications; a WatchKit app runs in the background on the iPhone as an application extension while a set of native user interface resources are installed on Apple Watch.[88][needs update] Thus, watchOS apps must be bundled within their respective iOS app, and are synced to the watch either manually, or automatically upon installation of the phone app.[14]From June 1, 2016, the only new watch apps allowed on the App Store will be those developed with the watchOS 2 (or later) SDK; no third-party languages or SDKs can be used to develop apps.[89]As of September 2019, six generations and six series of Apple Watch have been released. The series in bold are currently produced:Apple Watch models have been divided into five \"collections\": Apple Watch (1st gen-present), Apple Watch Sport (1st gen), Apple Watch Nike+ (Series 2-present), Apple Watch Hermès (1st gen-present), and Apple Watch Edition (1st gen-Series 3, Series 5). They are differentiated by combinations of cases, bands, and exclusive watch faces; Apple Watch comes with either aluminum or stainless steel cases, and various watch bands (only stainless steel was offered for Apple Watch 1st gen); Apple Watch Sport came with aluminum cases and sport bands or woven nylon bands; Apple Watch Nike+ comes with aluminum cases and Nike sport bands or sport loops; Apple Watch Hermès uses stainless steel cases and Hermès leather watch bands (also included is an exclusive Hermès orange sport band); and Apple Watch Edition came with ceramic cases and various bands (the 1st gen Apple Watch Edition used 18 karat yellow or rose gold).[90] With the Series 5, the Edition tier was expanded with a new titanium case.[78]Apple Watch Series 1 models were previously only available with aluminum cases and sport bands.[91]Apple Watch Series 3 and Series 4 models are also sold in variants that allows for cellular LTE capability.Each model through Series 3 comes in a 38- or 42-millimeter body, with the larger size having a slightly larger screen and battery.[14] The Series 4 has been updated to 40- and 44-millimeter models, respectively. Each model has various color and band options. Featured Apple-made bands include colored sport bands, sport loop, woven nylon band, classic buckle, modern buckle, leather loop, Milanese loop, and a link bracelet.[14]250 mA·h, 3.78 V, 0.93 W·h battery capacity (42 mm)[citation needed]334 mA·h, 3.80 V, 1.27 W·h battery capacity (42 mm)[citation needed]342 mA·h, 3.82 V, 1.31 W·h battery capacity (42 mm)[103]LTE: 279 mA·h, 3.82 V, 1.07 W·h battery capacity (38 mm)[104]352 mA·h,  3.82 V, 1.34 W·h battery capacity (42 mm)[105]44 mm: 291.8 mA·h, 3.81 V, 1.113 W·h battery capacity[107]44 mm: 296 mA·h, 3.814 V, 1.129 W·h battery capacity[108]LTE: 36 kg CO2e[120]LTE: 39 kg CO2e[122]Following the announcement, initial impressions from technology and watch industry observers were varied; the watch was praised by some for its \"design, potential capabilities and eventual usefulness\",[151] while others offered criticism of these same aspects.[151] Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said he \"can't wait\" to try it,[152] and Steve Jobs' biographer Walter Isaacson described it as \"extremely cool\" and an example of future technology that is \"much more embedded into our lives\".[153] However, Evan Dashevsky of PC Magazine said it offered nothing new in terms of functionality compared to the Moto 360, except the customizable vibration notifications.[154] In November 2014, Apple Watch was listed by Time as one of the 25 Best Inventions of 2014.[155]Initial reviews for the device have been generally positive with some caveats.[156] Reviewers praised the watch's potential ability to integrate into everyday life and the overall design of the product, but noted issues of speed and price. Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient, while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones. Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times mentioned the device's steep learning curve, stating it took him \"three long, often confusing and frustrating days\" to become accustomed to watchOS 1, but loved it thereafter.[157] Some reviewers also compared it to competing products, such as Android Wear devices, and claimed \"The Smartwatch Finally Makes Sense\".[158] Reviewers had mixed opinions on battery life though, with Geoffrey Fowler of The Wall Street Journal saying \"the battery lives up to its all-day billing, but sometimes just barely,\"[158] and others compared it to the Samsung Gear 2, which \"strolls through three days of moderate usage.\"[159] Tim Bradshaw of the Financial Times used several applications over a period of days. He concluded that there is no \"killer application\" so far besides telling the time, which is the basic function of a wristwatch anyhow.[160]When using the Apple Watch, some users have reported issues using the heart monitoring feature due to permanent skin conditions including tattoos. The Watch uses photoplethysmography technology (PPG) which utilizes the green LED lights to measure heart rates.[161] To gauge a user's heart rate, the watch flashes green light from the LEDs at the skin and records the amount of this light that is absorbed by the red pigment of the blood.[162] However, under certain circumstances the skin may not allow for the light absorption to be read properly and thus provide inaccurate results.[163]Some users have complained that the logo and text on the back of the Apple Watch Sport model, primarily the space gray version,[164] can be easily worn off.[165]Financial analysts offered early sales estimates from a few million to as many as 34.7 million in the first year.[166] Time's Tim Bajarin summarized the breadth of reactions, writing that \"there is not enough information yet to determine how this product will fare when it finally reaches the market next year\".[151]Owing to the inadequacy of materials, the Apple Watch's delivery was delayed from its initial pre-order release date of April 10, 2015.[167] As a result, only 22 percent of the pre-ordered Apple Watches were dispatched in the United States during the weekend after the release date.[168] It is estimated Apple received almost one million Apple Watch pre-orders in the United States during the initial six hours of the pre-order period on April 10, 2015, after which it sold out and further orders would start delivering in June.[169] A report later on by an analyst stated that Apple Watch was already a $10 billion business during its first year.[170][171][172]Apple has not disclosed any sales figures for the Apple Watch.[173] An estimate by IDC states Apple shipped over 12 million units in 2015.[174] In late 2016, a veteran of the Swiss watch industry said Apple sold about 20 million watches and had a market share of about 50 percent.[175]"

        "text": "Apple TV is a digital media player and microconsole developed and sold by Apple Inc. It is a small network appliance and entertainment device that can receive digital data for visual and audio content such as music, video, video games, or the screen display of certain other devices, and play it on a connected television set or other video display.Apple TV is an HDMI-compliant source device.[6] To use it for viewing, it has to be connected to an enhanced-definition or high-definition widescreen television via an HDMI cable. The device has no integrated controls and can only be controlled externally, either by an Apple Remote or Siri Remote control device (which is included with Apple TV) using its infrared/Bluetooth capability, by the Apple TV Remote app (downloadable from App Store) on numerous Apple devices using its Wi-Fi capability, or by some third-party gaming controllers and infrared remotes.[7][8]Apple TV runs software applications downloaded from Apple's tvOS App Store over the device's Wi-Fi connection, with the most popular being those that stream video.[9] Major online content sources for Apple TV apps include subscription services for streaming television and film, cable and broadcast networks via TV Everywhere, and major sports leagues.Its Wi-Fi capability is also used to receive content purchased or rented directly from Apple's ITunes Store, transmitted from other nearby IDevices via AirPlay, or shared from macOS or Windows computers running ITunes.According to observers, Apple's March 2019 special event highlighted the company's reorientation of its focus away from the Apple TV hardware, which has lagged competitors with only 13% of U.S. connected TV market share, and apps on the set-top box, and toward higher revenue Apple-distributed video streaming that will be available even through competitors' devices, via the company's Apple TV+ original content service and Apple TV Channels a la carte premium video on demand subscription aggregating service.[10][11][12][13][9][14][15][16][17]In an early attempt to enter the home entertainment industry, Apple released the Macintosh TV in 1993. Macintosh TV had a 14-inch CRT screen along with a TV tuner card.[18] This did not prove to be a success, as only 10,000 units of Macintosh TV were sold up to its discontinuation in 1994.[19]Apple's next foray into the television industry came with the Apple Interactive Television Box, also in 1994. Apple Interactive Television Box was a collaboration venture between Apple, BT, and Belgacom but it never went on sale to the public.[19][20]Apple's last major attempt to enter the home entertainment market before Apple TV occurred with their launch of Apple Bandai Pippin based on the Apple Pippin platform in the late 1990s. Apple Bandai Pippin combines a home game console with a networked computer.[19][21]Starting as early as 2011, Gene Munster, longtime investment banking analyst at Piper Jaffray covering Apple, led and persisted rumors that Apple would announce HDTV television set hardware to directly compete with Sony, LG, Samsung, and other TV makers,[22] but Apple has never released any such product and Munster finally relented and recanted in 2015.[23][24] This was despite the set being mentioned as a possibility for a future breakthrough product in Steve Jobs' biography Steve Jobs.[19][25][26][27]Apple TV was unveiled as a work in progress called \"iTV\" on September 12, 2006 at an Apple Special Event using a modified Front Row interface using the Apple Remote.[28][29] Apple started taking pre-orders for Apple TV on January 9, 2007. The name \"iTV\" was originally going to be used to keep the product in line with the rest of their \"i\"-based products (iMac, iPod, etc.), but was not used because the British terrestrial broadcast network ITV holds the rights to the name in the UK and threatened to take legal action against Apple.[30]Apple TV first shipped on March 21, 2007 with a 40 GB hard disk.[31] A updated model with a 160 GB HDD was released on May 31, 2007; subsequently, Apple ceased selling the 40 GB HDD version on September 14, 2009.[32]On January 15, 2008, a software upgrade was announced; this turned the Apple TV into a stand-alone device which removed the requirement for a computer running iTunes on Mac OS X or Windows to stream or sync content to it, and making most of the Apple TV's hard disk redundant. The update allowed the iTunes Store content to be directly rented and purchased, as well as photo streaming and podcast downloads from MobileMe (which was called .Mac at the time) and Flickr.[33] Front Row became deprecated, and a new interface was introduced for the original Apple TV in which content was organized into six categories, all of which appeared in a large square box on the screen upon startup (movies, TV shows, music, YouTube, podcasts, and photos) and presented in the initial menu, along with a \"Settings\" option for configuration, including software updates.[34][35]On July 10, 2008, Apple released the iTunes Remote app on the App Store,[36] and the Apple TV 2.1 software update that added recognition for the iPhone and iPod Touch as remote control devices intended as a software alternative to the Apple Remote.[37] Later updates to the Apple TV, iTunes, and Remote software added support for the iPad, and introduced support for new features as they were added to iTunes.In July 2011, Apple discontinued the Front Row interface for Mac users.[38]On September 9, 2015, Apple discontinued service and support for the first generation Apple TV.[6] Beginning May 25, 2018, iTunes Store is no longer accessible from the device, due to its obsolete security standards.[39]The 2nd generation Apple TV was announced on September 1, 2010, and was the first to run on a variant of iOS.[40][41][42] The device is housed in a smaller, all-black case, one-quarter the size of the original. This model replaced the internal hard drive with 8 GB internal flash storage, enough local storage for buffering purposes; all media became streamed, instead of synced. It supports output up to 720p over HDMI only.[43][44]In May 2015 the YouTube app was removed due to an API change by Google.[45]On March 7, 2012 Apple announced the 3rd generation Apple TV (model A1427) at an Apple Special Event. It is identical externally to the second generation model, includes a single-core A5 processor, and supports 1080p output.[46]Apple silently released a third generation \"Rev A\" (model A1469) on January 28, 2013 with component changes included. This refreshed model gained support for peer to peer Airplay which allowed iOS devices to mirror to the Apple TV without requiring both devices to be on the same WiFi network. This model also saw the dual core Apple A5 chip with one core deactivated being replaced with a single core variant of the A5 chip. Some users reported the Rev A drawing less power than the original 3rd generation Apple TV. By October 2016, Apple had phased out the Apple TV third generation, with Apple Store employees instructed to pull all units and demo units from store shelves.[47]Amazon Video was added with Software 7.2.2 released on December 6, 2017.[48] The TV app was added with Software 7.3 released on May 13, 2019.[49]On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the 4th generation Apple TV at an Apple Special Event. The 4th generation model uses a new operating system, tvOS, with an app store, allowing downloads of third-party apps for video, audio, games and other content. Upon release, third-party apps were available from a limited range of providers, with new APIs providing opportunities for more apps. A requirement of new apps and games was that they must include interfacing with the new touchpad-enabled Siri remote, which was later relaxed for games.[50][51][unreliable source?] In March 2019 Apple rebranded the device as Apple TV HD.[52]The 4th generation includes a 64-bit Apple A8 processor, and adds support for Dolby Digital Plus audio. While similar to the form factor of the 2nd and 3rd generation models, the 4th generation model is taller. In contrast to the old remote's arrow button, the 4th generation Apple TV's touch remote uses swipe-to-select features, Siri support, a built-in microphone, volume control over HDMI CEC and IR, and an accelerometer (IMU).[53]The 4th generation Apple TV started shipping in October 2015. Upon launch, there were several unexpected issues such as incompatibility with Apple's own Remote app for iOS and watchOS.[54] These issues were fixed by Apple on December 8, 2015 in tvOS 9.1.[55] On September 13, 2016, Apple released tvOS 10, bringing an all new remote app, single-sign on, dark mode, HomeKit support, and other features.Amazon initially declined to develop an Amazon Video application for Apple TV, and announced in October 2015 it would stop selling Apple TVs, and removed 3rd generation SKUs.[56] In late 2017 Amazon reversed their stance and released an Amazon Video app,[57] and resumed sales of Apple TVs.[58]At an Apple Special Event on September 12, 2017, Apple announced the 5th generation Apple TV, named Apple TV 4K, which supports 2160p output, HDR10, Dolby Vision, and includes a faster Apple A10X Fusion processor supporting HEVC hardware decoding. Dolby Atmos support was added in tvOS 12.[59][60] Externally it is similar to the 4th generation model, with the only differences being the addition of vents on the base, the removal of the USB-C port, and the addition of a white outline around the menu button on the included Siri Remote. Following the announcement of the new models, the 64 GB version of the 4th generation Apple TV was discontinued.[61]Apple TV allows consumers to use an HDTV to stream video, music, and podcasts as well as downloading apps and games from the tvOS App Store. The first, second, and third generations offered limited content which Apple had provisioned to work with Apple TV. These have now been discontinued[62] in favor of the fourth generation Apple TV, with an OS based on iOS called tvOS which lets developers create their own apps with their own interface that run on Apple TV. These include multimedia, music apps, and games.Features of Apple TV include:Since tvOS and watchOS are based on iOS, they have inherited many of the accessibility features of iOS and macOS[76] and are compatible with Apple's entire product line including the Apple Watch as a remote controller for the Apple TV.tvOS includes the Apple technologies of VoiceOver, Zoom, and Siri to help the blind and those with low vision. Pairing a Bluetooth keyboard with the tvOS on the Apple TV enables another accessibility feature that also is an incorporation of VoiceOver. When typing, VoiceOver mirrors with an audio voice, each character pressed on the keyboard and repeated again when it is entered. The Apple TV is designed to work with the Apple Wireless Keyboard or the Apple Magic Keyboard.[citation needed]Apple TV with and without tvOS supports closed captioning, so the deaf or hard of hearing can properly watch TV episodes and feature-length movies. Compatible episodes and movies are denoted with a CC (closed captioning) or SDH (Descriptive Audio) icon in the iTunes Store either on the Apple TV or in iTunes itself. The viewer can customize the captions in episodes or movies with styles and fonts that are more conducive to their hearing and/or visual impairment.[77]Apple's Remote app on iOS devices allows control of the Apple TV from an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.[78]Similar to Google's redesign of YouTube, Apple has restricted access to most viewed charts on movies and podcasts. They are replaced by \"Top Movies\", \"Top Podcasts\", and \"Editor's Picks\".[79]Parental controls allow consumers to limit access to Internet media service content via \"Restrictions\" settings; individual services can be turned off (e.g., to reduce clutter), icons can be rearranged via the tap-and-hold technique à la iOS. Internet media is split into four categories: \"Internet Photos\", \"YouTube\", \"Podcasts\", and \"Purchase and Rental\". Each of the categories is configured by a parental control of \"Show\", \"Hide\" or \"Ask\" to prompt for a 4-digit PIN. In addition, movies, TV shows, music and podcasts can be restricted by rating.[80]Apps available for Apple TV can stream video from a variety of sources, including Netflix, Stan, Foxtel Now, Hulu, Now TV (UK only), SlingTV, PlayStation Vue, Amazon Prime Video, DirecTV, YouTube, Red Bull TV, and Vevo along with HBO Now, Showtime Anytime, Starz, and the TV Everywhere portals of several cable and broadcast networks, and the video subscription portals of all of the four major North American sports leagues: NFL TV app, MLB.tv, NBA League Pass, and NHL.tv.Apple TV allows users on a computer running iTunes to sync or stream photos, music and videos.[81]A user can connect a computer on a local network to maintain a central home media library of digitized CD, DVD or HD content,[82] provide direct connectivity to photo organization software such as iPhoto,[83] limit home video access to a local network only,[84] play Internet radio,[85][86] or preload content on Apple TV to be used later as a non-networked video player.[87] For users who wish to connect the Apple TV to a computer, synchronization and streaming modes are supported.[81]Apple TV in synchronization mode works in a way similar to the iPod. It is paired with an iTunes library on a single computer and can synchronize with that library, copying all or selected content to its own storage. Apple TV need not remain connected to the network after syncing.[87][88] Photos can be synced from iPhoto, Aperture, or from a folder on a Mac, or Adobe Photoshop Album, Photoshop Elements, or from a hard disk folder in Windows.[89]Apple TV can also function as a peer-to-peer digital media player, streaming content from iTunes libraries and playing the content over the network.[90][91]1st generation Apple TVs can stream content from up to five computers or iTunes libraries. Also, five Apple TVs can be linked to the same iTunes library. The 2nd generation Apple TV onwards allows users to stream content from more than one iTunes library: these additional iTunes libraries can be on the same or on different computers. This is possible when Apple TV and every iTunes library from which you want to stream content meet all of the following conditions: (1) the Apple TV and the iTunes library you are streaming from are both on the same local network, (2) each uses the iTunes \"Home Sharing\" feature, and (3) each are using the same \"Home Sharing\" Apple ID.4th generation Apple TVs and newer can also stream content locally using third party apps such as Plex and VLC media player.Apple TV natively supports the following audio, video, and picture formats (although with the 4th generation, apps may use alternative built-in software in order to play other codecs and formats, e.g. VLC media player):Attempts to sync unsupported content to Apple TV will draw an error message from iTunes.[98]The 1st and 2nd generation Apple TV video output can be set to either 1080i or 1080p; however, this resolution is limited to the user interface and the viewing of photographs – all other content is simply upscaled to those resolutions. Those models cannot play 1080i or 1080p video content (e.g., HD camera video).[90][91][99][100][101] The 3rd and 4th generation Apple TV support 1080p video content. The Apple TV 4K, as the name suggests, supports 4K resolutions and HDR, including Dolby Vision. 4K content from sources such as iTunes can be played on a compatible 4K television set.Apple offers H.264 1080p movies and video podcasts on iTunes.[102] In comparison, Blu-ray Disc films are 1080p H.264 or VC-1 video encoded at rates of up to 40 Mbit/s.[103]Apple TV's audio chip supports 7.1 surround sound,[104] and some high definition rentals from iTunes are offered with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.[105]There is an Apple TV export option in QuickTime which allows content in some formats that the device does not support to be easily re-encoded.[106] Applications that use QuickTime to export media can use this; e.g., iMovie's Share menu,[107] iTunes' advanced menu,[108] and some third-party content conversion tools.[109]Apple TV streams video through an HDMI cable (Type A) connected to the TV's HDMI port. Audio is supported through the optical or HDMI ports. The device also has a Micro-USB port, which is reserved for service and diagnostics. The device connects through Ethernet or Wi-Fi to the computer for digital content from the Internet and local networks. Apple TV does not come with audio, video or other cables, which must be acquired additionally as required.[110] On the previous Apple TV, media files could be transferred directly onto the device by syncing with another computer. Once content was stored on the device's hard drive, Internet connectivity was no longer needed to view content.[87] This is not the case with the later models, which do not have a hard drive for storing media.The 1st generation Apple TV had component video and RCA connector audio ports, both removed in the 2nd generation. The device does not have RCA/composite video or F/RF connectors.[91][111]Starting with the 4th generation Apple TV, Apple removed the optical audio port. Apple also enhanced the HDMI port by adding support for HDMI 1.4. The 4th generation also removed the Micro-USB port in favor of the reversible USB-C port and the 5th generation removed USB entirely.[citation needed]AirPlay allows iOS devices or an AirPort-enabled computer with the iTunes music player to send a stream of music to multiple (three to six, in typical conditions) stereos connected to an AirPort Express (the audio-only antecedent of Apple TV) or Apple TV.[112]The AirPort Express' streaming media capabilities use Apple's Remote Audio Output Protocol (RAOP), a proprietary variant of RTSP/RTP. Using WDS-bridging,[113] the AirPort Express can allow AirPlay functionality (as well as Internet access, file and print sharing, etc.) across a larger distance in a mixed environment of wired and up to 10 wireless clients.Speakers attached to an AirPort Express or Apple TV can be selected from within the \"Remote\" iPhone/iPod Touch program, allowing full AirPlay compatibility[114] (see \"Remote control\" section below).A compatible Mac running OS X Mountain Lion or later can wirelessly mirror its screen to an Apple TV through AirPlay Mirroring[115][116] while one running OS X Mavericks or later can also extend its display with AirPlay Display.Apple TV can be controlled by many infrared remote controls[117] or paired with the included Apple Remote to prevent interference from other remotes.[90][118][119] Either kind of remote can control playback volume, but for music only.[33][120][121]The Apple Wireless Keyboard is supported on the 2nd generation Apple TV and later using the built-in Bluetooth.[122] The consumer has the ability to control media playback, navigate menus and input text and other information. Third-party keyboards that use the Apple layout may also be compatible.[122]On July 10, 2008, Apple released Remote, a free iOS application that allows the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad to control the iTunes library on the Apple TV via Wi-Fi.[123][124] The Apple Watch also has a remote app to control Apple TV.[125]The Remote App was updated on September 13, 2016,[126] to take advantage of all the features of the Apple TV 4. This includes Siri, Touchpad, and Home Buttons, along with a now playing screen.On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the new Siri Remote for the 4th generation Apple TV (although in some territories, Apple have kept the name Apple TV Remote, due to Siri functionality not being enabled on it in that territory).[127] It is a completely redesigned remote that features dual microphones for Siri support and a glass touch surface for navigation around the interface by swiping or tapping and scrubbing to fast forward or rewind. Also, it has a menu and home button, a Siri button to invoke Siri, a Play/Pause button, and a Volume Up/Down button to control the volume on the TV. The Siri Remote communicates with the Apple TV via Bluetooth rather than infrared, removing the requirement of a line-of-sight with the device. This new remote is only supported by the 4th generation Apple TV and later and will not work with earlier generations.Beginning with the 4th generation Apple TV, the remote includes two microphones and a button to activate Siri. Siri on the Apple TV has all of the functions of Siri on iOS 9; it can also respond to requests specifically for the TV.[128] For instance, the viewer can ask Siri to search for a TV show or movie and it will search across multiple different sources to tell the user where the content is available to watch. It can also do things such as Play/Pause,[129] Rewind/Fast Forward, skip back 15 seconds and temporarily turn on captioning when asked \"what did he say?\" or \"what did she say?\", open a specific app, and more.The original Apple TV ran a modified build of Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger[130]Apple TV software 1.0 presented the user with an interface similar to that of Front Row. Like Front Row on the Mac, it presents the user with seven options for consuming content. Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, Photos, Settings, and Sources. It was a modified version of OS x v10.4 Tiger.[131]In February 2008, Apple released a major and free upgrade to the Apple TV, labelled \"Take Two\"(2.0). This update did away with Front Row and introduced a new interface in which content was organized into six categories, all of which appeared in a large square box on the screen upon startup (movies, TV shows, music, YouTube, podcasts, and photos) and presented in the initial menu, along with a \"Settings\" option for configuration, including software updates.[34][35]In October 2009, Apple released a minor upgrade for the Apple TV called \"Apple TV Software 3.0\".[132] This update replaced the interface in version 2.0 with a new interface which presented seven horizontal columns across the top of the screen for the different categories of content (Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, Photos, Internet, and Settings).[133] This update also added features such as content filtering, iTunes Extras,[134] new fonts, and a new Internet radio app.One new feature in particular was the 'Genius' playlist option allowing for easier and more user friendly playlist creating[135]The 2nd[136] and 3rd[137] generation Apple TVs run a version of iOS, rather than the modified Mac OS X of the original model.The interface on Apple TV Software 4 is similar to that of previous versions, with only minor changes and feature additions throughout. In March 2012, Apple released a major new software update, with the Apple TV 3rd generation, labeled as Apple TV Software 5 (iOS 5.1),[138] which shipped with the new 3rd generation Apple TV. This update completely revised the look of the home screen to make it resemble the icon grid seen on iOS. Instead of 7 columns, content and third-party channels are shown in a tiled grid format,[139] which can be rearranged. Throughout the years, for Apple TV Software 5-6, Apple released minor revisions, content additions, and feature updates.The Apple TV Software 7.0 features a flat look similar to iOS 7 and OS X Yosemite and adds features such as Peer-To-Peer AirPlay.[140] Version 8.0 was skipped.Apple TV Software 7.2.2 (iOS 8) is currently available for the Apple TV (3rd generation), as of March 2019. It does not support tvOS 9.0 or later. However, it does support Amazon Video, which was automatically added to those Apple TVs running 7.2.2 on December 6, 2017.[48]In May 2019 Apple TV Software 7.3 was released to the public. This update was the first update for the 3rd generation Apple TV since 2016. This update adds the new Apple TV app to the home screen. The Apple TV app brings compatibility to the Apple TV Channels service. This update also fixes some security flaws found in Apple TV Software 7.2.2 and earlier.[141]On September 24, 2019, Apple TV Software 7.4 (iOS 8) was released to the public.[142]The fourth generation Apple TV and later run an operating system called tvOS[143] which does not support the earlier generations of Apple TV. It features an app store, allowing third-party app developers to release their own apps on the platform.[144] The new software also features support for Siri voice control. The tvOS software development kit (SDK) for developing tvOS apps is included in Xcode 7.1 and later.[145] A new development feature, App Thinning,[146] is used in the Apple TV, running on tvOS, due to the storage restrictions of the device (32 GB and 64 GB) and the dual-use of the NAND Flash Memory to precache movies from Apple's content servers as well as storage for downloaded applications from the tvOS App Store. Apple's aim is to limit the size of application downloads and steering users toward downloading individual segments of apps in order to better manage storage space. Developers have reacted with criticism toward the download size limits, arguing that it leads to situations where game data is purged and has to be re-downloaded.[146]Apple TV contains neither a TV tuner nor a personal video recorder.[90][98] Both capabilities can be applied to the connected home computer through various third-party products, such as allowing PVR software to connect to iTunes and enable scheduled HDTV recordings to play automatically via Apple TV for playback.[169]The Front Row interface lacks some iTunes functionality, including rating items, checking the account balance, adding funds to the account, synchronizing from more than one computer,[170] full Internet radio support,[91][171] and games.[172]The Movies search box only searches the iTunes Store, not local hard drives and networks.[173]Movies rented on Apple TV must be watched on Apple TV, unlike iTunes rentals, which can be transferred to any video-enabled iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.[174][175] Movies purchased on Apple TV can be moved to a video-enabled iPod or iPhone via iTunes.[176]Apple TV prior to 4th generation does not support the HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (HDMI CEC) protocol.On the Apple TV (2nd generation), digital output audio is up-sampled to 48 kHz, including lossless CD rips at 44.1 kHz. Although this is a higher frequency and the difference is not audible in most cases, it falls short of digital transmission of data standards due to the audio not being 'bit perfect'.[177]Within the first week of presales in January 2007, Apple TV was the top pre-selling item at the Apple Store.[178] Orders exceeded 100,000 units by the end of January and Apple began ramping-up to sell over a million units before the 2007 holiday season.[179] Analysts began calling it a \"DVD killer\"[180] that could enable multiple services. Analysts also predicted that Apple could sell up to 1.5 million units in the first year.[181] Besides the Apple Store, Best Buy was one of the first retailers to carry the device;[182] Target and Costco[183] followed shortly thereafter.Two months into sales, Forrester Research predicted at the time that Apple would only sell a million Apple TV units, because consumers prefer advertisement-supported content over paid content. Forrester predicted that cable companies would be the clear winners over content providers such as the iTunes Store.[184] Shortly after, Apple released YouTube functionality and Jobs stated that Apple TV was a \"DVD player for the Internet\". Some market analysts predicted that YouTube on Apple TV \"provides a glimpse of this product's potential and its future evolution\",[185] but overall, analysts had mixed reactions regarding the future of Apple TV. Some negative reactions followed after Jobs referred to the device as a \"hobby\", implying it was less significant than the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone.[186]In the fourth quarter of 2008, sales were triple that of the fourth quarter of 2007.[187]In Apple's first-quarter 2009 financial results conference call, acting chief executive Tim Cook stated that Apple TV sales increased three times over the same quarter a year ago. Cook mentioned that the movie rental business was working well for Apple, Apple would continue investment in movie rentals and Apple TV, but Apple TV is still considered a hobby for the company.[187] Due to the growth of digital TV and consumers turning to Internet media services, an analyst at the time predicted sales of 6.6 million Apple TVs by the end of 2009.[22]The second generation sold 250,000 units in the first two weeks it was available. On December 21, 2010, Apple announced that they had sold 1 million units.[188][unreliable source?] In the second fiscal quarter of 2011, it had topped 2 million in total sales, with 820,000 sold in that quarter alone.[189]On January 24, 2012, Apple announced they had sold 1.4 million units in the first fiscal quarter of 2012,[190] and 2.8 million units in all of fiscal year 2011.[191] (4.2 million units through January 1, 2012).Tim Cook announced at the All Things Digital conference in May 2012 that Apple had sold 2.7 million of the 3rd generation model in 2012.[192]In the Q4 FY2012 earnings call, Engadget reported comments from Tim Cook that Apple had shipped 1.3 million Apple TV units in the 4th Quarter (presumed to be 3rd generation).[193]MacObserver reported statements by Tim Cook in the Q1 FY2013 earnings call that Apple sold over 2 million Apple TV units in the December Quarter (presumed to be 3rd generation).[194][unreliable source?]These reports lead to a cumulative volume of the 3rd generation device of 6 million units, as of January 1, 2013.[citation needed]On February 28, 2014, at Apple's shareholders meeting, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that in 2013 Apple TV brought in 1 billion dollars of revenue for Apple.[195]A market survey published by Parks Associates in December 2014 found that Apple TV has lost consumer traction to Google Chromecast, garnering only a 17% market share.[196]Tim Cook announced at the Apple Watch conference on March 9, 2015, that Apple had sold a total of 25 million Apple TVs up to that point.[197]In the January 27, 2016, Apple earnings call, CEO Tim Cook stated that the Apple TV had record sales. However, no specific sales figures were mentioned; Apple TV is included in an \"Other products\" category, which also includes the Apple Watch, iPods, and Beats products, and is not broken down by individual products.[198] In June 2019 it was estimated that there are 53 million units of all generations in use worldwide.[199]Footnotes"

        "name": "Music",
        "text": "Apple Music is a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc. Users select music to stream to their device on-demand, or they can listen to existing, curated playlists. The service also includes the Internet radio station Beats 1, which broadcasts live to over 100 countries 24 hours a day. The service was announced on June 8, 2015, and launched on June 30, 2015 in over 100 countries worldwide. New subscribers get a three-month free trial period before the service requires a monthly subscription.Originally strictly a music service, Apple Music began expanding into video in 2016. Executive Jimmy Iovine has stated that the intention for the service is to become a \"cultural platform\", and Apple reportedly wants the service to be a \"one-stop shop for pop culture\". The company is actively investing heavily in the production and purchasing of video content, both in terms of music videos and concert footage that support music releases, as well as web series and feature films.The original iOS version of Apple Music received mixed reviews, with criticism directed towards a user interface deemed \"not intuitive\". However, it was praised for its playlist curation, vast library of songs to stream, and its integration with other Apple devices and services. In iOS 10, the app received a significant redesign, which received positive reviews for an updated interface with less clutter, improved navigation, and bigger emphasis on users' libraries. Apple Music rapidly gained popularity after its launch, passing the milestone of 10 million subscribers in only six months. The service has 60 million subscribers around the world as of June 2019.[1]Apple Music allows users to stream over 60 million songs to their device on demand. The service offers curated playlists by music experts and recommendations tailored to a users music preference.[2] Beats 1, the service's 24-hour radio station led by DJ Zane Lowe, broadcasts in over 100 countries.[3] The Beats 1 service is free for all users, even without an Apple Music subscription. Apple Music subscribers can create a profile to share their music with friends and follow other users to view the music they're listening to on a regular basis.[4] Apple Music's use of iCloud, which matches a users' songs to those found on the service, allows users to combine their iTunes music library with their Apple Music library and listen to their music all in one place. Additionally, the service is heavily integrated into Apple's own in-house services such as their personal voice assistant Siri as well as their audio and video streaming protocol AirPlay. As of late 2019, users also have the ability to access the full version of Apple Music through an Apple-designed web player in beta.Apple Music's interface consists of five tabs: \"Library\", \"For You\", \"Browse\", \"Radio\", and \"Search\". The \"Library\" tab shows the user's music collection, with options to view songs by \"Playlists\", \"Artists\", \"Albums\", \"Songs\", or \"Downloaded Music\". Below these options, the tab also shows music recently added to the user's library. The \"For You\" tab recommends music for the user based on their music tastes. Human expert selections supplement the algorithmic curation, while users are able to \"Like\" and \"Dislike\" songs to further improve music suggestions. \"Browse\" shows new album releases from artists, playlists curated by the Apple Music team, upcoming album releases, as well as different categories including \"Genres\", \"Moods\", \"Top Charts\", and \"Music Videos\". The \"Radio\" tab incorporates Beats 1 and other radio stations which play genre-specific or artist-related music, depending on the user's preference. Unlike traditional radio services, the radio feature in Apple Music allows users to skip songs, view previously played songs on the station, as well as view songs playing next. The \"Search\" tab features a search box where users can search for artists, albums, Apple Music users, or songs by name or by lyrics.[5] Below the search box, a list of recent user searches and overall trending searches on the service are shown.When a song is playing, a \"Now Playing\" bar appears above the bottom navigation bar. When viewed, the Now Playing section allows users to add a song to their library, download it to their device, and like or dislike the song to improve suggestions on the \"For You\" tab. Other functions of the \"Now Playing\" section include the ability to control what music plays next and put songs on shuffle or repeat. Additionally, users can view live lyrics of the song they are listening to through the now playing card, which displays the song's lyrics live in sync with the time while it plays to the user.[6]Each artist page includes a profile banner and a \"Play\" button which automatically creates a radio station based around the artist. Artist pages also include sections for their featured releases, albums, singles, top songs, and background information. Apple Music users have the ability create their own profile on the service, thus allowing them to follow other users and see what music their followers are listening to.[7]Users also have the ability to view their most played songs, artists, and albums of the entire year through a feature called Apple Music Replay, accessible on the \"For You\" tab.[8]The service is compatible with iOS devices running version 8.4 or later,[9] iPadOS devices running version 13.0 or later, Music app on macOS Catalina or later, iTunes version 12.2 or later for Windows PCs,[10] as well as Apple Watch, Apple TV, Apple CarPlay, and Apple HomePod.[9] It is also available for Android devices running version 4.3 or later, Chrome OS devices, Amazon Echo devices, and Sonos speakers. For devices without a native application, Apple Music is available on the web with a web player in beta.[11]Before Apple Music, the company's iPod and iTunes were known for having \"revolutionized digital music.\"[12] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs was known to be opposed to the idea of music subscription services.[13] When Apple bought audio equipment maker Beats Electronics in 2014, Apple gained ownership of Beats' own service Beats Music,[14] and made Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers responsible for the iTunes Radio service.[15] Business Insider later reported that Apple was planning to merge the two services. Apple also hired noted British radio DJ Zane Lowe to serve as a music curator.[16]After a period of rumors and anticipation, Sony Music CEO Doug Morris confirmed on June 7, 2015, that Apple had plans to announce a music streaming service, saying \"It's happening tomorrow,\"[17] with launch later in the month.[2] Morris emphasized several times that he prefers paid streaming as opposed to ad-supported, from a financial perspective. Furthermore, Morris said he expects the service to be the \"tipping point\" to accelerate the growth of streaming, along with arguing that Apple has \"$178 billion dollars in the bank. And they have 800 million credit cards in iTunes.\" as opposed to Spotify, which \"never really advertised because it’s never been profitable\". Morris further argued that \"Apple will promote this like crazy and I think that will have a halo effect on the streaming business. A rising tide will lift all boats. It's the beginning of an amazing moment for our industry.\"[17]Shortly before Apple Music was released, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift wrote an open letter publicly criticizing Apple's decision to not reimburse artists during a user's three-month free trial period and announced that she would be holding back her album 1989 from the service. She said the policy was \"unfair\" as \"Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months\".[18][19] UK independent record label Beggars Group also criticized the three-month trial period, saying it struggled \"to see why rights owners and artists should bear this aspect of Apple's customer acquisition costs\".[20][21]The day after Swift's letter, Apple's Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue announced on Twitter that Apple had changed its policy, and that Apple Music \"will pay artist for streaming, even during customer's free trial period\".[22][23][24] On Twitter, Swift wrote \"After the events of this week, I've decided to put 1989 on Apple Music... And happily so\". She concluded saying it was \"the first time it's felt right in my gut to stream my album\".[25]In negotiations with record labels for the new service, Apple allegedly attempted to encourage record labels to pull their content from the free, ad-supported tiers of competing services such as Spotify in order to drive adoption of Apple Music, and offered an incentive to Universal Music Group to pull its content from YouTube. The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into this alleged cartel in May 2015.[26][27]The announcement happened as the signature \"one more thing...\" reveal at Apple's conference.[28] Hip hop artist Drake appeared onstage at the announcement event to elaborate on how he used the Connect platform, and Apple subsequently emphasized how \"unsigned artists can share their music on Connect, too\", in contrast to the iTunes Store, where small, independent artists were finding it difficult to participate.[28]Apple Music launched on June 30, 2015, in 100 countries. New users receive a three-month free trial subscription, which changes to a monthly fee after three months. A family plan allows six users to share a subscription at a reduced rate.[2] Apple originally sought to enter the market at a lower price point for the service, but the music industry rejected the plan.[12] The service debuted as an updated Music app on the iOS 8.4 update. Apple TV and Android device support was planned for a \"fall\" 2015 launch.[28] A previously unreleased song by Pharrell Williams, entitled \"Freedom\", was used in promotional material and announced as an exclusive release on the launch of the service.[29] The \"History of Sound\" advert for the launch of the Apple Music service was soundtracked by the tune There Is No Light by Wildbirds & Peacedrums, from their 2009 album The Snake.[30] Upon its launch, Beats Music subscriptions and playlists were migrated to Apple Music, and the service was discontinued.[31]In May 2016, a student membership was announced, that discounted the regular price of a subscription by 50%. The student plan was initially only available for eligible students in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand,[32] but was expanded to an additional 25 countries in November 2016.[33]In February 2016, Music Business Worldwide reported that, with Apple Music having launched in Turkey and Taiwan in the previous week, the service was available in 113 countries. The publication further wrote that those countries accounted for 59 regions that competing service Spotify did not.[34] In August 2016, Apple Music was launched in Israel[35] and South Korea.[36]In January 2016, Fortune reported that, six months after launching, Apple Music had reached 10 million paying subscribers, having spent six months reaching the same customer base that took competing music streaming service Spotify six years.[37] This customer base increased to 11 million subscribers in February,[38] 13 million in April,[39] 15 million in June,[40] 17 million in September,[41] 20 million in December,[42][43] 27 million in June 2017,[44] 36 million in February 2018,[45] 38 million in March 2018 (just five weeks after the previous milestone[46]), 40 million in April 2018,[47] 50 million as of May 2018,[48], 56 million as of December 2018,[49] and 60 million as of June 2019.[50][51]By July 2018, Apple Music had surpassed Spotify in terms of paying users in the United States.[52]In October 2015, Drake and Apple signed a deal to release the music video for “Hotline Bling” exclusively on Apple Music.[53] In December, Apple released an exclusive Taylor Swift tour documentary, called the 1989 World Tour, on Apple Music.[54] In February 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Dr. Dre would be starring in and executive producing a \"dark semi-autobiographical drama\" called Vital Signs. The production was described as \"Apple's first scripted television series\".[55] Recode subsequently reported a few days later that the announcement of Dr. Dre's production was an effort to \"extend Apple Music\" in promotional ways rather than Apple actively exploring original television content. Citing Apple's deals with Drake and Swift in October and December 2015, respectively, the report referenced a Twitter user describing Apple's efforts as \"content marketing\".[56]In July 2016, Apple bought Carpool Karaoke from The Late Late Show with James Corden, with Variety writing that Apple was planning to distribute the series through Apple Music.[57] Apple's adaptation of the series was originally supposed to premiere in April 2017, but was delayed without explanation.[58][59] The series instead premiered on August 8, 2017.[60][61]In January 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was exploring original video content, including its own television series and movies.[62] A few days later, Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine confirmed the reports about the move towards video,[63] and in February, he announced that Apple Music would launch its first two television-style series in 2017, with the aim to turn Apple Music into a \"cultural platform\".[64] In March, The Information reported that Apple had recently hired several people to help evolve its video platform, including YouTube product manager Shiva Rajaraman.[65] In April, it was announced that Apple Music would be the exclusive home to Sean Combs's documentary \"Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story\", which premiered June 25.[66][67] On the same day, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that artist Will.i.am would make a reality show for Apple Music, in an effort to turn the service into a \"one-stop shop for pop culture\".[68] The reality show was later revealed to be called Planet of the Apps, and will focus on the \"app economy\".[69][70] The series has cast 100 developers,[71] and premiered on June 6, 2017.[72][73]In June 2017, Apple hired two television executives from Sony, specifically Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg. The two have jointly held the title of \"President\" at Sony, and have helped develop shows including Breaking Bad and Shark Tank. The hiring was noted by the media as another significant effort by Apple to expand into original video productions.[74][75][76] In early December 2017, Apple hired Michelle Lee, a programming veteran, as a creative executive of Apple's original video team,[77][78] and a few days later, also hired Philip Matthys and Jennifer Wang Grazier from Hulu and Legendary Entertainment, respectively.[79][80]In November 2015, Apple launched the Android version of Apple Music, touted by reporters as Apple's first \"real\" or \"user-centric\" Android app.[81][82] The app was updated in April 2017 to match the service's iOS 10 design.[83][84]Apple has added personalized music playlists to the service, with the September 2016 launch of “My New Music Mix”,[85] and the June 2017 launch of \"My Chill Mix\".[86][87]On November 30, 2018, Apple added support for Apple Music on Amazon Echo speakers, after previously only being accessible on Apple's own HomePod speakers.[88]On December 13, 2018, Apple discontinued Apple Music's \"Connect\" feature in favor for their redesigned approach to artist profiles and the ability for users to share their music and playlists with friends and followers introduced in iOS 11.[89]On September 5, 2019, Apple released the first version of an Apple Music web player in beta. The web player gives users full access to their music libraries along with similar features from the Apple Music app.[90]On November 15, 2019, Apple released a new Apple Music feature called Apple Music Replay, which is a year-end playlist showing users their favorite tracks of the entire year, a feature similar to that of Spotify's called Spotify Wrapped.[91]On November 20, 2019, Apple announced the Apple Music catalog now hosts over 60 million songs.[92]On November 20, 2019, Apple introduced Apple Music for Business, offering customized playlists for partnered retailers.[93]Apple Music received mixed reviews at launch. Among the criticism, reviewers wrote that the user interface was \"not intuitive\",[124] and an \"embarrassing and confusing mess\".[125] They also wrote about battery life problems.[126] However, the service was praised for its smart functions. Christina Warren of Mashable noted the emphasis on human curation in Apple Music, pointing out the various human-curated radio stations and the accuracy of the curated playlists recommended to users in the \"For Me\" section. The author concluded saying \"[The] For Me section alone has made me excited about music for the first time in a long time.\"[127] Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica wrote that Apple's emphasis on unsigned artist participation in the Connect feature could be an effort to restore the company's former reputation as a \"tastemaker\" in the mid-2000s.[28]Apple Music's major redesign in iOS 10 received more positive reviews. Caitlin McGarry of Macworld praised Apple for having \"cleaned up the clutter, reconsidered the navigation tools, put your library front and center, and added algorithmically created playlists to rival Spotify’s.\" She noted bigger fonts, large amounts of white space, and she welcomed changes to various functionalities, concluding with the statement that \"Apple Music’s redesign is a huge improvement over its previous incarnation, and a clear sign that Apple is listening to its customers\".[128] However, another Macworld editor, Oscar Raymundo, criticized the new design, writing that \"Apple Music in iOS 10 is not as elegant or intuitive as Apple promised. The music service added more needless options, key actions like repeat got buried, and the For You section leaves a lot to be desired\".[129] Jordan Novet of VentureBeat wrote positively about the changes, stating \"Apple has improved the overall design, as well as the experience\".[130]In December 2017, singer-songwriter Neil Young released a new archive as part of his Neil Young Archives project, and criticized Apple for the audio quality offered by its Apple Music streaming service, stating: \"Apple Music controls the audio quality that is served to the masses and chooses to not make high quality available, reducing audio quality to between 5 percent and 20 percent of the master I made in studio in all cases. So, the people hear 5 percent to 20 percent of what I created. ... Apple not offering a top-quality tier has led labels to stop making quality products available to the masses\".[131]The implementation of iCloud Music Library caused significant issues for users. There were reports about music libraries being impacted by issues such as tracks moved to other albums, album art not matching the music, duplicate artists[132] and songs, missing tracks, and synchronization problems.[133][134] Mashable wrote that \"Apple has not yet publicly acknowledged the problem or responded to our request for comment\".[133]iCloud Music Library has also been reported to delete music from users' local storage,[135] though this has been disputed by other publications as caused by user error or another application.[136] Additionally, the feature was reported to have replaced uploaded content with a version locked with digital rights management.[135] In July 2016, Apple switched the matching technology to incorporate features identical to iTunes Match, specifically the use of \"audio fingerprints\" to scan sound data. The new technology also removed DRM from downloaded matched songs.[137][138]In August 2016, Frank Ocean released Blonde exclusively on Apple Music. The decision was made by Ocean independently, without Def Jam Recordings, his former label, being a part of the deal. The exclusive deal reportedly \"ignited a music streaming war\".[139] The move followed in the footsteps of other artists, including Adele, Coldplay, Future, Drake, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Kanye West, who released albums on exclusive terms with music streaming competitors of leading service Spotify. Jonathan Prince, Spotify's head of communications, told The Verge that \"We’re not really in the business of paying for exclusives, because we think they’re bad for artists and they’re bad for fans. Artists want as many fans as possible to hear their music, and fans want to be able to hear whatever they’re excited about or interested in — exclusives get in the way of that for both sides. Of course, we understand that short promotional exclusives are common and we don't have an absolute policy against them, but we definitely think the best practice for everybody is wide release\".[140] Ocean's independent move to Apple Music exclusivity caused \"a major fight in the music industry\",[141] and Universal Music Group reportedly banned the practice of exclusive releases for its signed artists.[142] Soon after, several major record labels followed Universal, marking a significant change in the industry.[143] According to unnamed label executives, Spotify had also introduced a new policy that said that the service would not give the same level of promotion once an album arrives on Spotify after other services, including not being prominently featured in playlists.[144] Rolling Stone wrote in October 2016 that \"if you wanted to keep up with new albums by Beyoncé, Drake, Frank Ocean and Kanye West, among many others, you would have had to subscribe to not one but two streaming services\", adding, \"But over the past few months, a backlash has developed against this new reality\".[145] Lady Gaga told Apple Music's Beats 1 radio, \"I told my label that if they signed those contracts with Apple Music and Tidal, I'd leak all my own new music\".[145]In May 2017, Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine told Music Business Worldwide, \"We tried it. We’ll still do some stuff with the occasional artist. The labels don’t seem to like it and ultimately it’s their content.\"[146][147]"

        "name": "AirPods",
        "text": "AirPods are wireless Bluetooth earbuds created by Apple. They were first released on December 13, 2016. They are sold alongside the premium AirPods Pro.In addition to playing audio, AirPods feature a built-in microphone that filters out background noise, which allows taking phone calls and talking to Apple's digital assistant, Siri. Additionally, built-in accelerometers and optical sensors can detect taps (e.g. double-tap to pause audio) and in-ear placement, which enables automatic pausing when they are taken out of the ears.[3]On March 20, 2019, Apple released the second generation AirPods, which feature the H1 chip, longer talk time, and hands-free \"Hey Siri\" support. An optional wireless charging case was added in the offerings.AirPods were announced on September 7, 2016 at an Apple Special Event alongside the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2. Apple originally planned to release them in late October,[4] but delayed the release date.[5] On December 13, 2016, Apple began taking orders online. They were available at Apple Stores, Apple Authorized Resellers, and select carriers on December 20.[6][7]AirPods contain a proprietary Apple W1 SoC which helps optimize battery use and processes the Bluetooth 4.2 connection as well as audio. The additional connectivity functions of the W1 requires devices running iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3, or later.[1] They can also function as standard Bluetooth headphones when connected to any device that supports Bluetooth 4.0 or higher, including Android devices.[8][9][10][11] There are two microphones in each AirPod, one at ear level, facing outward, and another at the bottom of the stem.[12][13]Each AirPod weighs 0.14 oz (4 g), and its charging case weighs 1.34 oz (38 g). AirPods holds a charge of around five hours, while charging them for fifteen minutes in the case gives three hours of listening time. The charging case provides 24 hours of total usage.[14] During a teardown, each AirPod was found to contain a 93 milliwatt hour battery in its stem, while the charging case contains a 1.52 watt hour or 398 mAh at 3.81 V battery.[15]They were discontinued on March 20, 2019 after the second generation was released.[16]Apple announced 2nd generation AirPods on March 20, 2019.[17][18] They include an H1 processor which supports hands-free \"Hey Siri\", Bluetooth 5 connectivity, and Apple claims 50% more talk time and faster device connection times.[19] “Announce Messages with Siri” was added in iOS 13.2, which allows Siri to dictate and reply to text messages.[20]2nd generation AirPods can be purchased with the same charging case as the 1st generation, or for an additional $40 bundled with the Wireless Charging Case, which can be used with Qi chargers. The Wireless Charging Case can be purchased separately for $79 and is compatible with 1st generation AirPods. It moves the charging indicator LED to the exterior of the case.[21] The Wireless Charging Case was initially announced in September 2017 alongside the AirPower charging mat, but was delayed by AirPower's protracted development and eventual cancellation.[22]AirPods are compatible with any device that supports Bluetooth 4.0 or higher, including Android devices, although certain features such as automatic switching between devices are only available on Apple devices using iCloud.[9] AirPods have full functionality with the following devices:[23]2nd generation AirPods are compatible with devices running iOS 12.2 or later, macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later, and watchOS 5.2 or later.Apple has a program to service batteries and purchase replacement individual AirPods and charging cases.[24]AirPods contain upgradeable firmware. Its original firmware was 3.3.1. In February 2017, Apple released 3.5.1,[25] 3.7.2 in May 2017,[26] and then 6.3.2 after on March 26, 2019.[27] In July 2019, 6.7.8 was released and 6.8.8 followed in September 2019. Latest firmware is 1A691 (G2). AirPods automatically sync through Apple's iCloud service allowing users to switch audio sources to other supported devices connected by the same Apple ID.[28]On announcement day, AirPods were compared to Apple's previously existing EarPods (2012–present), with The Verge noting \"They look... just like the old EarPods, with the wires cut off.\"[29] Initially mocked by many for its unfamiliar design (including CNN asking \"Would people actually wear these?\" in 2016),[30] its popularity grew rapidly over the years and was voted the most popular \"hearable\" brand of 2019.[36]One criticism of AirPods is their high price (about $150); however, at launch they were actually priced less than most \"true wireless\" earbuds on the market (e.g. the Samsung Gear IconX and Bragi Dash) and remain competitively priced with similar products from other major brands.[37] Another criticism is the perceived tendency to fall out of one's ear; however, testing by Business Insider has shown that it is quite unlikely for this to happen during normal use for most ear types.[38]Another prominent criticism was an issue that caused the charging case battery to deplete at a rapid rate despite the AirPods not being used. Users were reporting upwards of 30% idle discharge per day.[39] In response, Apple upgraded the AirPods' firmware to version 3.5.1, which addressed connectivity and battery drain issues.[40]The Lithium-ion batteries in AirPods can see significant degradation over time, with two-year-old sets lasting for less than half of the advertised five hours.[41][42] Apple offers \"battery service\" for $49 per AirPod or case, but this is actually a replacement program as batteries in AirPods cannot be removed.[43]Analysts estimate Apple sold between 14 million and 16 million AirPods in 2017.[44] In 2018 AirPods were Apple's most popular accessory product, with 35 million units sold.[45][31] 15.9 million units were sold in the first half of 2019.[46] Analysts estimate AirPods make up 60% of the global wireless headphone market.[47] An estimated 5-7% of Apple's revenue from AirPods comes from replacement earbuds and cases.[48]"

        "name": "HomePod",
        "text": "HomePod is a smart speaker developed by Apple Inc., the company's second speaker after the iPod Hi-Fi. Announced on 5 June 2017, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference,[6][7] its launch was later delayed from December 2017 to early 2018.[7][8][9][10] Apple began taking orders on 26 January 2018,[11] and formally released it on 9 February 2018.Designed to accompany other Apple products such as the iPhone and Mac, the HomePod is designed to work with Apple Music to create a \"new way for you to discover and interact with music at home,\" according to Apple marketers.[12] It incorporates beamforming and eight speakers[13] and is sold in two colors: White and Space Gray.[14]The HomePod received mixed reviews: it was praised for its design and sound quality compared to other speakers of its price, and criticized for lack of third-party support and high price compared to other smart speakers. As well, the silicone base on the bottom of the device was found to occasionally damage wooden surfaces. As of August 2018, the HomePod had sold an estimated 1 to 3 million units.The HomePod has a rounded, cylindrical shape, and has a small touchscreen on its top. It has seven tweeters in its base and a four-inch woofer (Apple does not specify Hz frequency range) towards the top, as well as six microphones used for voice control and acoustic optimization.[15][16][17][18]The device runs a version of the iOS operating system specifically designed for the HomePod speaker to play audio, run the Siri voice assistant and control the device's screen. The processor featured in the HomePod is an Apple A8 system-on-chip, previously featured in some of Apple's phones and tablet computers such as the iPhone 6 and iPad Mini 4. [16][17] It integrates Siri, which can be used to control the speaker and other HomeKit devices, and can be used to conduct text messaging and voice calls from an iPhone. The HomePod mainly supports proprietary Apple platforms and technologies, including Apple Music, iTunes Store purchases and Match, iTunes podcasts, Beats 1 radio, and AirPlay (with limited third-party support for internet radio services iHeartRadio, Radio.com, and TuneIn coming in the fall of 2019), while an iOS 11 device is required for initial setup. HomePod can serve as a sound bar within a home entertainment system when selected through an Apple TV. The HomePod does not officially support audio-in from Bluetooth sources.[19][17] Andrew Faden has developed a solution he calls \"BabelPod\" to allow line in and Bluetooth input to the HomePod through the use of a Raspberry Pi.[20]AirPlay 2 and multi-room, multi-speaker support were announced in February 2018, and released in September 2018 in iOS 12 along with additional features such as multiple named timers, Find my iPhone, Siri shortcuts, the ability to make, receive and screen phone calls directly on the HomePod, and the ability to search for songs using the lyrics.[21] HomePod initially lacked support for allowing multiple users to use the device[22], but it was later announced that multi-user support would be added in iOS 13 when it's released in the fall of 2019.[needs update]Greenhouse gas emissions for production, expected use and recycling for the HomePod are estimated at 146 kg CO2e.[23]The HomePod received mixed reviews. The review from The Verge praised the HomePod's automatic acoustic calibration system, and felt that it sounded \"noticeably richer and fuller\" than competitors such as the Sonos One (described as sounding \"a little empty\") and Google Home Max (described as being a \"bass-heavy mess\").[13] The review from Ars Technica stated that the sound quality of the HomePod was \"pretty good, rich and full for its size, better than the Sonos One but probably not $150 better, [and] a galaxy ahead of the Echo.\"[22]Its lack of support for third-party services and platforms was criticized,[17][22][13] with Ars Technica arguing that it gave the device \"intense inflexibility\".[22] Siri on the HomePod was also criticized for its limited functionality in comparison to assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant; The Verge cited the inability to actually place phone calls from the speaker (they must be made on an iPhone and transferred to the HomePod), set multiple timers at once, or distinguish between multiple voices, and only supporting basic commands when using AirPlay, among other limitations.[13][17] Multiple reminders can be used in lieu of multiple timers, albeit with less precision than a timer.[24][25][26][27][28][29] All these issues have been fixed in iOS 12, released on 17 September 2018.[21]The Verge gave HomePod a 7.5 out of 10, arguing that it \"does more to make music sound better than any other speaker of this kind has ever done before\", but that consumers should consider other options \"unless you live entirely inside Apple's walled garden and prioritize sound quality over everything else.\"[13] Wired shared similar criticisms over its lack of Siri functionality and support for third-party services, concluding that the HomePod would be of little interest to those who are not heavily invested in Apple's software and hardware ecosystem.[17]It was reported by some owners that the HomePod's silicone base stained oiled wooden surfaces with a white \"ring\" mark.[30] Although Apple states that \"it is not unusual for any speaker with a vibration-dampening silicone base to leave mild marks when placed on some wooden surfaces\", and that the marks would eventually \"improve\" on its own, Stuart Miles (founder of the British technology blog Pocket-lint) reported that in his experience, the stain occurred after only about 20 minutes of use on a wooden surface, and that he had to sand and re-oil the surface to remove it.[31] John Gruber criticized Apple for this abnormality, remarking that he had never seen an Apple product damage surfaces in such a manner before, and that it \"seems like an issue that should have been caught during the period where HomePod was being widely tested at home by many Apple employees.\"[32]Strategy Analytics estimated that 600,000 HomePods were sold in first quarter of 2018, making Apple the fourth best selling smart speaker brand after Amazon, Google and Alibaba, giving Apple a 6% market share in the industry.[33] The HomePod also has 6% market share in the United States according to a report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners and sold an estimated 700,000 units worldwide in the second quarter of 2018.[34][35] Also in the second quarter of 2018, Strategy Analytics estimated that the HomePod outsold all smart speakers that cost more than $200, giving Apple a 70% market share in premium brand smart speakers.[36] As of mid 2018, the HomePod had sold an estimated 3 million units.[37] Sales increased 45% in Q4 2018, with Apple selling 1.6 million units that quarter. [38] In April 2019, Apple reduced the price to USD $299.[39]"

It connects to the Internet only through Wi-Fi base stations, does not use cellular network data, and is therefore not a smartphone. Similarly to an iPhone, it can be used as a music player, digital camera, web browser, note-logger, and handheld gaming device.[7] As of May 2013, 100 million iPod Touch units had been sold since 2007.[2]iPod Touch models are sold by storage space and color, with all models of the same generation typically offering otherwise identical features, processors, performance, and available operating system upgrades. An exception was the fifth generation, in which the low-end (16 GB)[8] model was initially sold without a rear-facing camera.[9] The current iPod touch is the seventh-generation model, released on May 28, 2019.The iPod Touch is currently the only product in Apple's iPod product line, following the discontinuation of the iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle on July 27, 2017. Following the discontinuation, Apple revised the storage and pricing for the iPod Touch with 32 and 128 GB of storage.[10]The iPod Touch runs Apple's Unix-based iOS operating system (called 'iPhone OS' until 2010) and includes bundled software to browse the Internet, view maps, send and receive email, view media, and work with office documents, presentations, and spreadsheets. Users type on a virtual keyboard displayed on the screen. Apple operates an online store, allowing users to buy and directly download music, videos and third-party software. From launch, the iPod Touch was described by journalists as an 'iPhone without the phone',[11] and each iPod Touch model to date has been introduced with the same release number of iOS as the contemporary iPhone model.Successive updates to iOS since the initial release in 2007 have released additional features. iPhone OS 2.0, released on July 11, 2008, introduced the App Store, which allowed third-party applications for the first time. iPhone OS 3.0, released on June 17, 2009, added features such as cut, copy, and paste, data tethering and push notification support. iOS 4.0, released on June 21, 2010, introduced iBooks, FaceTime, and multitasking. It dropped support for the first generation iPod Touch.In June 2011, iOS 5, the fifth major release of iOS software, was announced at Apple's WWDC 2011, which added notification, messaging and reminder features.[12] Apple limited some features, most notably the voice control system Siri, to the iPhone.[13] iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012 to the fourth and fifth generation iPod Touch models, contains 200 new features including Passbook, Facebook integration and Apple Maps. The fifth generation iPod Touch gained the ability to take panoramic photos, a feature shared with the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5.[14]On June 8, 2015, it was announced at the WWDC that the iPod Touch fifth generation would support iOS 9, along with other A5 Chip devices. This makes the iPod Touch fifth generation the first iPod Touch to support four major versions of iOS.Recent iOS updates have been free for owners of supported iPod Touch models, but Apple received criticism for charging iPod Touch owners for versions 2.0 and 3.0, which iPhone owners received for free, and for excluding certain features from the iPod Touch software that the iPhone included.[15][16] Apple's position was that they could add features for free to the iPhone because the revenue from it is accounted for on a subscription basis under accounting rules, rather than as a one time payment.[17] At WWDC in June 2010, as of iOS 4, Steve Jobs announced that Apple had \"found a way\" to make subsequent OS upgrades available free to iPod Touch owners.To purchase content on the iPod Touch, the user must create an Apple ID or have an existing account. With this account one may download music and videos from the iTunes Store, apps from the App Store, or books from the iBook store. An Apple ID account created without a credit card can be used to get free content, and gift cards can be bought to pay for apps instead of using credit cards. This is convenient for users who want to purchase an app, song, video, or E-book, but do not have a credit card.The only official way to obtain third-party applications for the iPod Touch is Apple's App Store, which is a branch of iTunes Store. The App Store application, available in all versions of iOS from 2.0 onwards, allows users to browse and download applications from a single online repository (hosted by Apple) with the iTunes Store. To develop such software, a software development kit (SDK) was officially announced on March 6, 2008, at an Apple Town Hall meeting.[18] The iOS SDK allows making applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch after paying a fee to join the development team. The developer can then set the price for the applications they develop and will receive 70% of money earned. Apple retains 30% of the sale price with no minimum fixed fee.However, Saurik, developer of Cydia, made a tool called Cydia Impactor. This tool allowed users (provided that they have registered for a free developer Apple ID), to sideload apps onto their iPhone.Like all of Apple's iOS devices, the iPod Touch is a tightly controlled or closed platform. Modifying or replacing the operating system voids the device warranty, communication between apps is limited and controlled, and Apple is the only authorized software vendor. Hackers have attempted to 'jailbreak' all iOS devices to enable forbidden or unsupported features, such as multitasking in iOS versions before 4.0, themes for the home screen and the use of software Apple has refused to sell such as a battery percentage indicator. Jailbreaks for the iPod Touch first surfaced a month after the first model was released in September 2007, when hackers released JailbreakMe 1.0 (also called \"AppSnapp\") to jailbreak iPhone OS 1.1.1.[19][20] This allowed users to install third-party programs on their devices before Apple permitted this.Apple's warranty statement implies that an iPod Touch after jailbreaking or other modification made by unofficial means is not covered by Apple's warranty. Jailbreaking is a violation of the Terms and Conditions for using iOS. While the jailbreaking process can normally be undone by performing a restore through iTunes,[21] there is a risk of bricking the device.The iPod Touch is generally similar to the iPhone. Compared to a same-generation iPhone, an iPod Touch is thinner, lighter and less expensive, while lacking some hardware and software features. Steve Jobs once referred to the iPod Touch as \"training wheels for the iPhone\".[22]All iPod Touch models lack Touch ID, Face ID, 3D Touch, NFC, GPS, an earpiece speaker and a noise-cancelling microphone. Depending on the generation, the iPod Touch may have a smaller or inferior display and camera(s). Newer models (5th, 6th, and 7th generation) lack the ambient light sensor that makes automatic brightness available. The first generation iPod touch lacks a built-in speaker, and the first, second, and third generation iPod Touch lack a microphone, a camera, and a flash. Starting with the 4th generation iPod Touch, a camera and microphone were added, and starting with the 5th generation iPod Touch, support for AirDrop and an LED flash were added.The iPod Touch has no cellular modem, and therefore cannot make phone calls. However, it can make FaceTime calls over an internet connection, and send iMessages to other iPhones, Macs, iPads, and iPod Touches with an Apple ID. The 5th generation iPod Touch and later can forward phone calls through a separate iPhone, with the Wi-Fi Calling feature. The two devices must be paired, and the iPhone's carrier must support this feature.[23]As of the 7th Generation iPod Touch:For iPod Touch units bought before October 12, 2011 users must own a Mac or PC computer to be able to use the iPod. Users then must install iTunes and connect the iPod through a USB port. The iPod will then be set up in iTunes. New iPods bought after October 12, 2011 have iOS 5.0 preloaded, and allow activation wirelessly, without the need of a PC or Mac.[24]Earlier iPod Touch units must be plugged into a computer to be synced. This will charge the iPod Touch and sync the music library, videos, pictures and backup data. iOS 5 enables the user to do all this from the device and send it to the iCloud service, which supports macOS Lion and later.Starting with the second generation model, the iPod Touch dropped support charging from the 12 V pin of a FireWire cable.[25] Charging the iPod Touch takes about 2 hours (80 percent capacity) for fast charge, and full charge takes about 4 hours.[citation needed]The fifth, sixth, and seventh generations of the iPod touch both feature a new dock connector, called \"Lightning\", which replaces the 30-pin dock connector on older iPhone, iPad and iPod models. The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all the signaling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one allowing for a slimmer form factor. Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on both sides of the plug, this makes the plug reversible. Various accessories are available to connect the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin dock connector or USB,[26] although not all old accessories will work, because the lightning connector cannot handle analog signals.[27]As of May 2019, there are seven types of produced iPod Touch devices."

        "name": "Gift Cards",
        "text": "A gift card also known as gift certificate in North America, or gift voucher or gift token in the UK [1] is a prepaid stored-value money card, usually issued by a retailer or bank, to be used as an alternative to cash for purchases within a particular store or related businesses. Gift cards are also given out by employers or organizations as rewards or gifts. They may also be distributed by retailers and marketers as part of a promotion strategy, to entice the recipient to come in or return to the store, and at times such cards are called cash cards. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees. American Express, MasterCard, and Visa offer generic gift cards which need not be redeemed at particular stores, and which are widely used for cashback marketing strategies. A feature of these cards is that they are generally anonymous and are disposed of when the stored value on a card is exhausted.From the purchaser's point of view, a gift card is a gift, given in place of an object which the recipient may not need, when the giving of cash as a present may be regarded as socially inappropriate. In the United States, gift cards are highly popular, ranking in 2006 as the second-most given gift by consumers, the most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males.[citation needed] Gift cards have become increasingly popular as they relieve the donor of selecting a specific gift.[2] In 2012, nearly 50% of all US consumers claimed to have purchased a gift card as a present during the holiday season.[3] In Canada, $1.8 billion was spent on gift cards, and in the UK it is estimated to have reached £3 billion in 2009,[needs update] whereas in the United States about US$80 billion was paid for gift cards in 2006.[4][5] The recipient of a gift card can use it at their discretion within the restrictions set by the issue, for example as to validity period and businesses that accept a particular card.Neiman Marcus introduced the first giftcard using a payments infrastructure in late 1994,[6] though Blockbuster Entertainment was the first company to do so on a wide scale,[7] test-marketing them in 1995 and launching them around the country the next year. In the beginning, the Blockbuster giftcard replaced gift certificates that were being counterfeited with recently introduced color copiers and color printers. Blockbuster's first giftcard transactions were processed by what was then Nabanco of Sunrise, Florida Nabanco was the developer of the first third-party platform for the processing of gift cards using existing payment infrastructure.Neiman Marcus and Blockbuster were later followed by the Mobil gas card, which initially offered prepaid phone value provided by MCI. Kmart was next with the introduction of the Kmart Cash Card, which in the early generations provided prepaid phone time with AT&T. Later Kmart and Mobil dropped this feature, as it was not profitable for them. The Kmart Mags Pangilinan Cash Card was the first replacement for cash returns when a shopper did not have a receipt for a gift. This practice of giving a cash card in place of cash for non-receipted returns is commonplace today with most merchants. From these early introductions, other retailers began to adapt a giftcard program to replace their gift certificate programs.A gift card may resemble a credit card or display a specific theme on a plastic card the size of a credit card. The card is identified by a specific number or code, not usually with an individual name, and thus could be used by anybody. They are backed by an on-line electronic system for authorization. Some gift cards can be reloaded by payment and can be used thus multiple times.Cards may have a barcode or magnetic strip, which is read by an electronic credit card machine. Many cards have no value until they are sold, at which time the cashier enters the amount which the customer wishes to put on the card. This amount is rarely stored on the card but is instead noted in the store's database, which is cross linked to the card ID. Gift cards thus are generally not stored-value cards as used in many public transport systems or library photocopiers, where a simplified system with no network stores the value only on the card itself. To thwart counterfeiting, the data is encrypted. The magnetic strip is also often placed differently than on credit cards, so they cannot be read or written with standard equipment. Other gift cards may have a set value and need to be activated by calling a specific number.Gift cards can also be custom tailored to meet specific needs. By adding a custom message or name on the front of the card, it can make for an individualized gift or incentive to an employee to show how greatly they are appreciated.Gift cards are divided into open loop or network cards and closed loop cards. The former are issued by banks or credit card companies and can be redeemed by different establishments, the latter by a specific store or restaurant and can be only redeemed by the issuing provider. The latter, however, tend to have fewer problems with card value decay and fees.[8] In either case the giver would buy the gift card and may have to pay an additional purchase or activation fee, and the recipient of the card would use the value of the card at a later transaction. A third form is the hybrid closed loop card whose issuer has bundled a number of closed loop cards; an example is free gift cards for a specific shopping mall.Gift cards differ from scrip gift certificates, in that the latter are usually sold as a paper document with an authorized signature by a restaurant, store, or other individual establishment as a voucher for a future service; there is no electronic authorization. A gift certificate may or may not have an expiration date and generally has no administrative fees.Bank issued gift cards may be used in lieu of checks as a way to disburse rebate funds. Some retailers use the gift card system for refunds in lieu of cash thereby assuring that the customer will spend the funds at their store.A charity gift card allows the gift giver to make a charitable donation and the gift recipient to choose a charity that will receive the donation.Mobile gift cards are delivered to mobile phones via email or SMS, and phone apps allow users to carry only their cell phone. Benefits include tying them to a particular phone number and ease of distribution.Virtual gift cards are delivered via email to the recipient, the benefits being that they cannot be lost and that the consumer does not have to drive to the brick and mortar location to purchase a gift card.Other companies have introduced virtual gift cards that users redeem on their smartphones. As the merchant is not involved in the loop, it is considered a cash transfer rather than a traditional gift card.It has been argued that holiday giving destroys value due to mismatching gifts.[9] The most efficient way to keep value in gifting would be to give cash; however, this is socially acceptable only within limits. Gift cards, to a degree, may overcome this problem but have certain pitfalls. Some feel that the absence of the thought of selecting a specific gift makes a gift card a worse choice than a poorly executed but individual gift.[10] New products in the gift card industry are evolving to tackle this \"impersonal\" pitfall of gift cards; new services launched by some service providers allows for customization and personalization of gift cards.[11]Gift cards have been criticized for the issuers ability to set rules that are detrimental to the purchaser or card recipient. For example, gift cards may be subject to an expiry date, administrative fees, restrictions on use, and absence of adequate protection in case of fraud or loss.[2] Over time fees may render the value of a gift card zero. However, these issues have been addressed in recent years in some jurisdictions. In the United States, many jurisdictions limit or prohibit all fees or expiration dates for gift cards. Furthermore, because of the negative impact on sales that such policies can have, most merchants have adopted and even advertise a no fee, no expiration policy for their gift cards, whether or not state laws require it. In 2011, an estimated 2.5% of gift cards were subject to an expiration date and 2.7% to post sale fees.[12]A quarter of gift card recipients still have not spent gift cards a year after receiving them, according to a Consumer Reports survey, and a majority of people say they end up spending more than the value of the card once they get to the store.[13]In the event of the bankruptcy of the issuing retailer, the outstanding value on gift cards is considered unsecured debt, and as such gift cards may become valueless.[13] If the company intends to continue trading, gift cards may be honoured even in bankruptcy.Another issue regarding gift cards is the growing concerns from retailers and other businesses about what can be done to prevent gift cards from being exploited by fraudsters. Gift card information can either be stolen from their rightful owners by fraudsters or they can be purchased with stolen credit card information. In recent years, cyber criminals have increased their efforts to take advantage of fraudulent gift cards as they are simple to exploit with automated brute-force bot attacks.[14] The most common form of gift card fraud is committed through the act of stealing card information for activated cards with an existing balance by attacking a retailer's systems which store gift card data. Once a gift card has been compromised, the fraudster will then check the balance through online customer portals before using the funds or reselling on the secondary gift card market.[15]Not all gift cards are redeemed. The card may be lost, there may be time decay expiration and fees or complex rules of redemption, or the recipient may not be interested in the store that accepts the card or be under the false assumption that not using it will save money for the giver. It has been estimated that perhaps 10% of cards are not redeemed, amounting to a gain for retailers of about $8 billion in the United States in 2006.[5]In 2012, over $100 billion in gift cards will be purchased in the United States, where over 20% of those gift cards will go unredeemed or unused. This has amassed a large opportunity in the secondary market, similar to the secondary ticket market in the early 2000s. Some companies have created a business in the secondary gift card market that allow consumers to sell their unused gift cards or buy discounted gift cards to their favorite brands. This has helped their users recoup their share of some $55 million per day that goes unredeemed in the United States every year, by turning their unused gift cards into cash.[citation needed]All Canadian provinces have legislations passed to ban expiry dates and fees collected on gift cards.[16] However, provincial gift card legislations do not apply to sectors that are regulated under federal laws. For example, gift cards that resemble credit cards i.e. with American Express, MasterCard, or Visa branding and phone cards are regulated by the federal government. Under the federal Prepaid Payment Products Regulations, effective 1 May 2014, federally regulated gift cards may only charge maintenance fees under certain conditions and may not set an expiry date for funds on those cards.[17]In the past, uniform standards concerning gift cards did not exist. This was set to change as an addendum to the Credit CARD Act of 2009 directs the federal government to create consumer-friendly standards pertaining to gift cards.[18] Most notably, the new regulations prohibit retailers from setting expiration dates unless they are at least 5 years after the card's date of issue or the date on which funds were last added to the card. In addition, retailers are no longer able to assess dormancy, inactivity, or service fees unless the card has been inactive for at least 12 months, and if fees are added after that period, the details of such fees must be clearly disclosed on the card. Additionally, retailers are unable to levy more than one fee per month. The new provisions took effect on 22 August 2010.[19]Open loop cards are governed by rules of the Comptroller of the Currency; however, oversight has been criticized.[2] Closed loop gift cards are subject to rules set by different state regulations, and issuing authorities vary widely in the rules they set for the consumer.[2] Moreover, rules can be changed by the issuer without notifying the consumer.[8][5]"

        "name": "Apple Music",
        "text": "Apple Music is a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc. Users select music to stream to their device on-demand, or they can listen to existing, curated playlists. The service also includes the Internet radio station Beats 1, which broadcasts live to over 100 countries 24 hours a day. The service was announced on June 8, 2015, and launched on June 30, 2015 in over 100 countries worldwide. New subscribers get a three-month free trial period before the service requires a monthly subscription.Originally strictly a music service, Apple Music began expanding into video in 2016. Executive Jimmy Iovine has stated that the intention for the service is to become a \"cultural platform\", and Apple reportedly wants the service to be a \"one-stop shop for pop culture\". The company is actively investing heavily in the production and purchasing of video content, both in terms of music videos and concert footage that support music releases, as well as web series and feature films.The original iOS version of Apple Music received mixed reviews, with criticism directed towards a user interface deemed \"not intuitive\". However, it was praised for its playlist curation, vast library of songs to stream, and its integration with other Apple devices and services. In iOS 10, the app received a significant redesign, which received positive reviews for an updated interface with less clutter, improved navigation, and bigger emphasis on users' libraries. Apple Music rapidly gained popularity after its launch, passing the milestone of 10 million subscribers in only six months. The service has 60 million subscribers around the world as of June 2019.[1]Apple Music allows users to stream over 60 million songs to their device on demand. The service offers curated playlists by music experts and recommendations tailored to a users music preference.[2] Beats 1, the service's 24-hour radio station led by DJ Zane Lowe, broadcasts in over 100 countries.[3] The Beats 1 service is free for all users, even without an Apple Music subscription. Apple Music subscribers can create a profile to share their music with friends and follow other users to view the music they're listening to on a regular basis.[4] Apple Music's use of iCloud, which matches a users' songs to those found on the service, allows users to combine their iTunes music library with their Apple Music library and listen to their music all in one place. Additionally, the service is heavily integrated into Apple's own in-house services such as their personal voice assistant Siri as well as their audio and video streaming protocol AirPlay. As of late 2019, users also have the ability to access the full version of Apple Music through an Apple-designed web player in beta.Apple Music's interface consists of five tabs: \"Library\", \"For You\", \"Browse\", \"Radio\", and \"Search\". The \"Library\" tab shows the user's music collection, with options to view songs by \"Playlists\", \"Artists\", \"Albums\", \"Songs\", or \"Downloaded Music\". Below these options, the tab also shows music recently added to the user's library. The \"For You\" tab recommends music for the user based on their music tastes. Human expert selections supplement the algorithmic curation, while users are able to \"Like\" and \"Dislike\" songs to further improve music suggestions. \"Browse\" shows new album releases from artists, playlists curated by the Apple Music team, upcoming album releases, as well as different categories including \"Genres\", \"Moods\", \"Top Charts\", and \"Music Videos\". The \"Radio\" tab incorporates Beats 1 and other radio stations which play genre-specific or artist-related music, depending on the user's preference. Unlike traditional radio services, the radio feature in Apple Music allows users to skip songs, view previously played songs on the station, as well as view songs playing next. The \"Search\" tab features a search box where users can search for artists, albums, Apple Music users, or songs by name or by lyrics.[5] Below the search box, a list of recent user searches and overall trending searches on the service are shown.When a song is playing, a \"Now Playing\" bar appears above the bottom navigation bar. When viewed, the Now Playing section allows users to add a song to their library, download it to their device, and like or dislike the song to improve suggestions on the \"For You\" tab. Other functions of the \"Now Playing\" section include the ability to control what music plays next and put songs on shuffle or repeat. Additionally, users can view live lyrics of the song they are listening to through the now playing card, which displays the song's lyrics live in sync with the time while it plays to the user.[6]Each artist page includes a profile banner and a \"Play\" button which automatically creates a radio station based around the artist. Artist pages also include sections for their featured releases, albums, singles, top songs, and background information. Apple Music users have the ability create their own profile on the service, thus allowing them to follow other users and see what music their followers are listening to.[7]Users also have the ability to view their most played songs, artists, and albums of the entire year through a feature called Apple Music Replay, accessible on the \"For You\" tab.[8]The service is compatible with iOS devices running version 8.4 or later,[9] iPadOS devices running version 13.0 or later, Music app on macOS Catalina or later, iTunes version 12.2 or later for Windows PCs,[10] as well as Apple Watch, Apple TV, Apple CarPlay, and Apple HomePod.[9] It is also available for Android devices running version 4.3 or later, Chrome OS devices, Amazon Echo devices, and Sonos speakers. For devices without a native application, Apple Music is available on the web with a web player in beta.[11]Before Apple Music, the company's iPod and iTunes were known for having \"revolutionized digital music.\"[12] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs was known to be opposed to the idea of music subscription services.[13] When Apple bought audio equipment maker Beats Electronics in 2014, Apple gained ownership of Beats' own service Beats Music,[14] and made Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers responsible for the iTunes Radio service.[15] Business Insider later reported that Apple was planning to merge the two services. Apple also hired noted British radio DJ Zane Lowe to serve as a music curator.[16]After a period of rumors and anticipation, Sony Music CEO Doug Morris confirmed on June 7, 2015, that Apple had plans to announce a music streaming service, saying \"It's happening tomorrow,\"[17] with launch later in the month.[2] Morris emphasized several times that he prefers paid streaming as opposed to ad-supported, from a financial perspective. Furthermore, Morris said he expects the service to be the \"tipping point\" to accelerate the growth of streaming, along with arguing that Apple has \"$178 billion dollars in the bank. And they have 800 million credit cards in iTunes.\" as opposed to Spotify, which \"never really advertised because it’s never been profitable\". Morris further argued that \"Apple will promote this like crazy and I think that will have a halo effect on the streaming business. A rising tide will lift all boats. It's the beginning of an amazing moment for our industry.\"[17]Shortly before Apple Music was released, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift wrote an open letter publicly criticizing Apple's decision to not reimburse artists during a user's three-month free trial period and announced that she would be holding back her album 1989 from the service. She said the policy was \"unfair\" as \"Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months\".[18][19] UK independent record label Beggars Group also criticized the three-month trial period, saying it struggled \"to see why rights owners and artists should bear this aspect of Apple's customer acquisition costs\".[20][21]The day after Swift's letter, Apple's Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue announced on Twitter that Apple had changed its policy, and that Apple Music \"will pay artist for streaming, even during customer's free trial period\".[22][23][24] On Twitter, Swift wrote \"After the events of this week, I've decided to put 1989 on Apple Music... And happily so\". She concluded saying it was \"the first time it's felt right in my gut to stream my album\".[25]In negotiations with record labels for the new service, Apple allegedly attempted to encourage record labels to pull their content from the free, ad-supported tiers of competing services such as Spotify in order to drive adoption of Apple Music, and offered an incentive to Universal Music Group to pull its content from YouTube. The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into this alleged cartel in May 2015.[26][27]The announcement happened as the signature \"one more thing...\" reveal at Apple's conference.[28] Hip hop artist Drake appeared onstage at the announcement event to elaborate on how he used the Connect platform, and Apple subsequently emphasized how \"unsigned artists can share their music on Connect, too\", in contrast to the iTunes Store, where small, independent artists were finding it difficult to participate.[28]Apple Music launched on June 30, 2015, in 100 countries. New users receive a three-month free trial subscription, which changes to a monthly fee after three months. A family plan allows six users to share a subscription at a reduced rate.[2] Apple originally sought to enter the market at a lower price point for the service, but the music industry rejected the plan.[12] The service debuted as an updated Music app on the iOS 8.4 update. Apple TV and Android device support was planned for a \"fall\" 2015 launch.[28] A previously unreleased song by Pharrell Williams, entitled \"Freedom\", was used in promotional material and announced as an exclusive release on the launch of the service.[29] The \"History of Sound\" advert for the launch of the Apple Music service was soundtracked by the tune There Is No Light by Wildbirds & Peacedrums, from their 2009 album The Snake.[30] Upon its launch, Beats Music subscriptions and playlists were migrated to Apple Music, and the service was discontinued.[31]In May 2016, a student membership was announced, that discounted the regular price of a subscription by 50%. The student plan was initially only available for eligible students in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand,[32] but was expanded to an additional 25 countries in November 2016.[33]In February 2016, Music Business Worldwide reported that, with Apple Music having launched in Turkey and Taiwan in the previous week, the service was available in 113 countries. The publication further wrote that those countries accounted for 59 regions that competing service Spotify did not.[34] In August 2016, Apple Music was launched in Israel[35] and South Korea.[36]In January 2016, Fortune reported that, six months after launching, Apple Music had reached 10 million paying subscribers, having spent six months reaching the same customer base that took competing music streaming service Spotify six years.[37] This customer base increased to 11 million subscribers in February,[38] 13 million in April,[39] 15 million in June,[40] 17 million in September,[41] 20 million in December,[42][43] 27 million in June 2017,[44] 36 million in February 2018,[45] 38 million in March 2018 (just five weeks after the previous milestone[46]), 40 million in April 2018,[47] 50 million as of May 2018,[48], 56 million as of December 2018,[49] and 60 million as of June 2019.[50][51]By July 2018, Apple Music had surpassed Spotify in terms of paying users in the United States.[52]In October 2015, Drake and Apple signed a deal to release the music video for “Hotline Bling” exclusively on Apple Music.[53] In December, Apple released an exclusive Taylor Swift tour documentary, called the 1989 World Tour, on Apple Music.[54] In February 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Dr. Dre would be starring in and executive producing a \"dark semi-autobiographical drama\" called Vital Signs. The production was described as \"Apple's first scripted television series\".[55] Recode subsequently reported a few days later that the announcement of Dr. Dre's production was an effort to \"extend Apple Music\" in promotional ways rather than Apple actively exploring original television content. Citing Apple's deals with Drake and Swift in October and December 2015, respectively, the report referenced a Twitter user describing Apple's efforts as \"content marketing\".[56]In July 2016, Apple bought Carpool Karaoke from The Late Late Show with James Corden, with Variety writing that Apple was planning to distribute the series through Apple Music.[57] Apple's adaptation of the series was originally supposed to premiere in April 2017, but was delayed without explanation.[58][59] The series instead premiered on August 8, 2017.[60][61]In January 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was exploring original video content, including its own television series and movies.[62] A few days later, Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine confirmed the reports about the move towards video,[63] and in February, he announced that Apple Music would launch its first two television-style series in 2017, with the aim to turn Apple Music into a \"cultural platform\".[64] In March, The Information reported that Apple had recently hired several people to help evolve its video platform, including YouTube product manager Shiva Rajaraman.[65] In April, it was announced that Apple Music would be the exclusive home to Sean Combs's documentary \"Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story\", which premiered June 25.[66][67] On the same day, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that artist Will.i.am would make a reality show for Apple Music, in an effort to turn the service into a \"one-stop shop for pop culture\".[68] The reality show was later revealed to be called Planet of the Apps, and will focus on the \"app economy\".[69][70] The series has cast 100 developers,[71] and premiered on June 6, 2017.[72][73]In June 2017, Apple hired two television executives from Sony, specifically Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg. The two have jointly held the title of \"President\" at Sony, and have helped develop shows including Breaking Bad and Shark Tank. The hiring was noted by the media as another significant effort by Apple to expand into original video productions.[74][75][76] In early December 2017, Apple hired Michelle Lee, a programming veteran, as a creative executive of Apple's original video team,[77][78] and a few days later, also hired Philip Matthys and Jennifer Wang Grazier from Hulu and Legendary Entertainment, respectively.[79][80]In November 2015, Apple launched the Android version of Apple Music, touted by reporters as Apple's first \"real\" or \"user-centric\" Android app.[81][82] The app was updated in April 2017 to match the service's iOS 10 design.[83][84]Apple has added personalized music playlists to the service, with the September 2016 launch of “My New Music Mix”,[85] and the June 2017 launch of \"My Chill Mix\".[86][87]On November 30, 2018, Apple added support for Apple Music on Amazon Echo speakers, after previously only being accessible on Apple's own HomePod speakers.[88]On December 13, 2018, Apple discontinued Apple Music's \"Connect\" feature in favor for their redesigned approach to artist profiles and the ability for users to share their music and playlists with friends and followers introduced in iOS 11.[89]On September 5, 2019, Apple released the first version of an Apple Music web player in beta. The web player gives users full access to their music libraries along with similar features from the Apple Music app.[90]On November 15, 2019, Apple released a new Apple Music feature called Apple Music Replay, which is a year-end playlist showing users their favorite tracks of the entire year, a feature similar to that of Spotify's called Spotify Wrapped.[91]On November 20, 2019, Apple announced the Apple Music catalog now hosts over 60 million songs.[92]On November 20, 2019, Apple introduced Apple Music for Business, offering customized playlists for partnered retailers.[93]Apple Music received mixed reviews at launch. Among the criticism, reviewers wrote that the user interface was \"not intuitive\",[124] and an \"embarrassing and confusing mess\".[125] They also wrote about battery life problems.[126] However, the service was praised for its smart functions. Christina Warren of Mashable noted the emphasis on human curation in Apple Music, pointing out the various human-curated radio stations and the accuracy of the curated playlists recommended to users in the \"For Me\" section. The author concluded saying \"[The] For Me section alone has made me excited about music for the first time in a long time.\"[127] Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica wrote that Apple's emphasis on unsigned artist participation in the Connect feature could be an effort to restore the company's former reputation as a \"tastemaker\" in the mid-2000s.[28]Apple Music's major redesign in iOS 10 received more positive reviews. Caitlin McGarry of Macworld praised Apple for having \"cleaned up the clutter, reconsidered the navigation tools, put your library front and center, and added algorithmically created playlists to rival Spotify’s.\" She noted bigger fonts, large amounts of white space, and she welcomed changes to various functionalities, concluding with the statement that \"Apple Music’s redesign is a huge improvement over its previous incarnation, and a clear sign that Apple is listening to its customers\".[128] However, another Macworld editor, Oscar Raymundo, criticized the new design, writing that \"Apple Music in iOS 10 is not as elegant or intuitive as Apple promised. The music service added more needless options, key actions like repeat got buried, and the For You section leaves a lot to be desired\".[129] Jordan Novet of VentureBeat wrote positively about the changes, stating \"Apple has improved the overall design, as well as the experience\".[130]In December 2017, singer-songwriter Neil Young released a new archive as part of his Neil Young Archives project, and criticized Apple for the audio quality offered by its Apple Music streaming service, stating: \"Apple Music controls the audio quality that is served to the masses and chooses to not make high quality available, reducing audio quality to between 5 percent and 20 percent of the master I made in studio in all cases. So, the people hear 5 percent to 20 percent of what I created. ... Apple not offering a top-quality tier has led labels to stop making quality products available to the masses\".[131]The implementation of iCloud Music Library caused significant issues for users. There were reports about music libraries being impacted by issues such as tracks moved to other albums, album art not matching the music, duplicate artists[132] and songs, missing tracks, and synchronization problems.[133][134] Mashable wrote that \"Apple has not yet publicly acknowledged the problem or responded to our request for comment\".[133]iCloud Music Library has also been reported to delete music from users' local storage,[135] though this has been disputed by other publications as caused by user error or another application.[136] Additionally, the feature was reported to have replaced uploaded content with a version locked with digital rights management.[135] In July 2016, Apple switched the matching technology to incorporate features identical to iTunes Match, specifically the use of \"audio fingerprints\" to scan sound data. The new technology also removed DRM from downloaded matched songs.[137][138]In August 2016, Frank Ocean released Blonde exclusively on Apple Music. The decision was made by Ocean independently, without Def Jam Recordings, his former label, being a part of the deal. The exclusive deal reportedly \"ignited a music streaming war\".[139] The move followed in the footsteps of other artists, including Adele, Coldplay, Future, Drake, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Kanye West, who released albums on exclusive terms with music streaming competitors of leading service Spotify. Jonathan Prince, Spotify's head of communications, told The Verge that \"We’re not really in the business of paying for exclusives, because we think they’re bad for artists and they’re bad for fans. Artists want as many fans as possible to hear their music, and fans want to be able to hear whatever they’re excited about or interested in — exclusives get in the way of that for both sides. Of course, we understand that short promotional exclusives are common and we don't have an absolute policy against them, but we definitely think the best practice for everybody is wide release\".[140] Ocean's independent move to Apple Music exclusivity caused \"a major fight in the music industry\",[141] and Universal Music Group reportedly banned the practice of exclusive releases for its signed artists.[142] Soon after, several major record labels followed Universal, marking a significant change in the industry.[143] According to unnamed label executives, Spotify had also introduced a new policy that said that the service would not give the same level of promotion once an album arrives on Spotify after other services, including not being prominently featured in playlists.[144] Rolling Stone wrote in October 2016 that \"if you wanted to keep up with new albums by Beyoncé, Drake, Frank Ocean and Kanye West, among many others, you would have had to subscribe to not one but two streaming services\", adding, \"But over the past few months, a backlash has developed against this new reality\".[145] Lady Gaga told Apple Music's Beats 1 radio, \"I told my label that if they signed those contracts with Apple Music and Tidal, I'd leak all my own new music\".[145]In May 2017, Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine told Music Business Worldwide, \"We tried it. We’ll still do some stuff with the occasional artist. The labels don’t seem to like it and ultimately it’s their content.\"[146][147]"

        "name": "Apple News+",
        "text": "Apple News is a mobile app and news aggregator developed by Apple Inc., for its iOS, watchOS, and macOS operating systems. The iOS version was launched with the release of iOS 9. It is the successor to the Newsstand app included in previous versions of iOS. Users can read news articles with it, based on publishers, websites and topics they select, such as The New York Times, technology or politics.[4]The app was announced at Apple's WWDC 2015 developer conference. It was released alongside the iOS 9 release on September 16, 2015, for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. At launch, the app was only available to users in the United States, but within a month had become available to users in Australia and the United Kingdom.[5]It was reported in 2014 that Apple Inc. had acquired the Netherlands-based digital magazine company Prss, developers of an application that simplified the creation of iPad-compatible magazines using a WYSIWYG editor that didn't require any knowledge of code.[6] Prss was seen as a magazine version of iBooks Author. The idea for Prss came after entrepreneur Michel Elings and longtime travel writer and photographer Jochem Wijnands designed their own iPad publication called TRVL. The Prss invention became what is now 'Apple News.'[7]During the keynote address at WWDC 2016, it was revealed that with the forthcoming iOS 10 update the News app will undergo new icon and app redesigns along with an improved For You section organized by topics. Furthermore, it was announced that there would be support for paid subscriptions for certain news sources and publishers as well as an opt-in system for breaking news notifications and email on top news stories.During the 2018 WWDC, Apple announced that the Apple News app would be ported to macOS and be available to users in Australia, United Kingdom, and United States starting in macOS 10.14.[8] The app is installed by default in every region but is not made visible to users outside those three regions. Users can still open it using various workarounds.[8]In February 2019 Digiday reported that publishers are frustrated over the platform's lack of revenue,[9] despite seeing steady growth in audience over the past year.In March 2019 Apple added support for Canada, and added a paid subscription version.The Apple News app works by pulling in news stories from the web through various syndication feeds (Atom and RSS)[10] or from news publishing partners through the JSON descriptive Apple News Format.[11] Any news publisher can submit their content for inclusion in Apple News, and users can add any feed through the Safari web browser. Stories added through Safari will be displayed via the in-app web browser included with the app.News is fetched from publisher's websites through the AppleNewsBot web crawler bot. The bot fetches feeds, as well as web pages and images for the Apple News service. It has received criticism for being poorly behaved and not being fault tolerant; resulting in high loads on websites.[12]The Apple News version distributed with iOS 9 made it hard to differentiate traffic originating from within the app from traffic originating from other apps. Apple News version 2, introduced in iOS 10, began identifying itself using its own User-Agent string, making it possible to measure the reach of Apple News using web analytics solutions.[13] Traffic analytics was previously only available to paying publisher partners through iAds.In WWDC 2018, Apple announced that the News app would be available in macOS Mojave.On March 25, 2019, iOS 12.2 was released with the updated News app that introduced subscriptions through Apple's \"Apple News+\" service, which was announced on the same day. [14] The icon for Apple News also changed, putting the N in the icon front and center with a slightly changed design.[15]On March 25, 2019, Apple announced Apple News+, a subscription-based service allowing access to content from over 300 magazines, as well as selected newspapers.[16] The service was preceded by the digital media subscription app Texture, which Apple acquired in 2018.[17]Wall Street Journal, one of the newspapers available through Apple News+, will reconfigure its services to offer more articles for casual readers. It will not actively display business-intensive articles through the Apple platform, though they will still be available by searching through a three-day archive.[18]"

        "name": "Apple TV+",
        "text": "Apple TV+ is an over-the-top ad-free subscription video on demand web television service of Apple Inc. that debuted on November 1, 2019.[2] It was announced during their March 25 Apple Special Event held at Steve Jobs Theater,[3][4] where celebrities involved with Apple TV+ projects appeared on-stage for the announcement, including Jennifer Aniston, Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Jason Momoa.[5][6][7]Apple TV+ content is viewable through Apple's website and through Apple's TV app, which in 2019 expanded its availability to numerous consumer electronics devices, including those of Apple's competitors, with further plans to expand availability to more devices over time.[8][9][6][10][11] However, Apple has created no native app for the Windows and Android platforms, or an official method to stream the content on television-connected Android TV and Chromecast devices, leaving users of those devices to workarounds for viewing Apple TV+.[12][13][14][15]At debut, Apple TV+ was accessible in about 100 countries and dependent territories, fewer than the early reported target of a global launch in 150 countries,[16][17] and not including a number of the highest population countries in the world, within some of which Apple sells other content generally.[18][19][20] However, commentators note that the fairly wide initial reach of the service will offer it an advantage over other streaming services debuting at approximately the same time in a more limited number of countries, such as Disney+, and that because Apple distributes its own content through the service instead of the third-party licensed content used by more established streaming services like Hulu, it will not be hamstrung by international content licensing issues during global expansion.[21][22][23][24]Apple TV+, along with the simultaneously announced Apple TV Channels a la carte premium video subscription aggregation service, is part of the company's concerted effort to expand its service revenues by making recurring monthly charge distributed video content available widely to the public.[8][25][26]Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning a streaming television service, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with various television studios and programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle.[27][28] Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator, Eddy Cue.[27]In October 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook was reported as saying that television is \"of intense interest to me and other people here.\" He added that Apple has \"started focusing on some original content\" which he called \"a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on.\"[29]In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps in forming its new television unit by poaching the co-presidents of Sony Pictures Television, Jamie Elricht and Zack van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming.[28][30] Staff acquisition and financial investments rapidly followed as many additional people were brought onboard.In October 2017, following reports of sexual abuse allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein, Apple announced that they were severing ties with The Weinstein Company and cancelling a planned biopic series about Elvis Presley.[42]In April 2018, Apple signed Kerry Ehrin to a multi-year deal to produce original content.[43]In June 2018, Apple signed the Writer's Guild of America's minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership.[44][45] That same month, Apple announced that they given a multi-series order to Sesame Workshop to produce various live-action and animated series as well as a single puppet-based series.[46]In September 2018, it was reported that Apple had decided to shelve Vital Signs, a six-episode biopic television series centering on the life of hip-hop producer and performer Dr. Dre and starring Ian McShane, Sam Rockwell, and Michael K. Williams, due to concerns about the show's content being too graphic with moments cited including characters using cocaine, instances of gun violence, and an explicit orgy scene. Reports further indicated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was taking a hands-on approach in regards to the company's Worldwide Video Unit with programming decisions reportedly being aligned to Cook's personal tastes, with a preference for family-friendly shows. Various programs in different stages of production have apparently had their content altered including the toning down of the Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston morning show drama series and the removal of crucifixes from a scene in the M. Night Shyamalan drama series. Additionally, Apple reportedly passed on a television series from comedian Whitney Cummings about the #MeToo movement because it was \"too sensitive a topic.\"[47][48][49] The Cummings series was ultimately put into development by Amazon Video in October 2018.[50]In November 2018, Apple entered into a multi-year agreement with entertainment company A24 to produce a slate of original films in partnership with their Worldwide Video Unit.[51]That same month, Apple signed a deal with DHX Media, and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, to develop and produce original programs, including new series, specials and shorts based on the Peanuts characters created by Charles M. Schulz. One of the first productions created through the deal was an original short-form, STEM-related series featuring astronaut Snoopy.[52] Also that month, Apple signed Justin Lin, and his production company Perfect Storm Entertainment, to a multi-year overall deal to produce original television content.[53]In January 2019, Apple signed Jason Katims, and his production company True Jack Productions, to a multi-year overall production and development deal to produce original television content.[54] That same month, Apple signed a first look deal with Imagine Documentaries to develop non-fiction features and series.[55] In February 2019, Harpo Productions hired Terry Wood as executive Vice President in which Wood will oversee Harpo's production of original programming for Apple as part of the multi-year agreement between Oprah Winfrey and Apple.[56] In March 2019, it was reported that five television series commissioned by Apple had finished filming and six series would finish filming in the next few months. Furthermore, it was revealed that the crucifixes in the untitled M. Night Shyamalan series would remain.[57]On April 10, 2019, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, announced on Instagram that he was working alongside Winfrey on the mental health documentary series as a co-creator and executive producer.[58]In May 2018, it was reported that Apple was expected to start a sister project to its original content service, and begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via its TV application on iOS and tvOS, rather than asking Apple device owners to subscribe to those services through applications individually downloaded from Apple's application store.[59]In October 2018, it was reported that Apple would be distributing their future original content through a still-in-development digital video service to be located within their TV application that is pre-installed in all iOS and tvOS devices. The service was expected to feature both original content, free to owners of Apple devices, as well as subscription \"channels\" from legacy media companies such as HBO and Starz, which would allow customers to sign up for online-only services.[60] Later that month, it was further reported that Apple intended to roll out the service in the United States during the first half of 2019 and that it would expand its availability to around 100 countries in the months following its initial launch.[61]On March 25, 2019, Apple held a press event to announce Apple TV+. At the event, Apple showed a teaser of its upcoming original content and formally announced some of its content with actors and producers attached to the content attending the event. Furthermore, Helpsters, the first series from Sesame Workshop (which also produces Sesame Street), was announced, and Oprah Winfrey announced her first projects for Apple TV+ including a documentary—under the working title Toxic Labor[62]—about workplace sexual harassment, a documentary series about mental health as well as a revival of Oprah's Book Club as a standalone television series.[63][64]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced at their yearly keynote that Apple TV+ would launch on November 1, 2019, at $4.99 USD a month (with a 1-week free trial) for an account that can be shared with up to six family members. Apple also announced that they would be giving away a year of Apple TV+ for free to anyone who bought a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, or Apple TV beginning that same day.[65] Student subscribers to the monthly Apple Music service at a discounted rate also have Apple TV+ bundled in at no additional cost for the time being.[66]On October 17, 2019, Irish telecommunications company eir[67] confirmed it will be the first non-Apple related company to use the Apple TV 4K set-top boxes as its main source of supplying digital television content along with Apple content.During the announcement of Apple TV+, Apple announced a number of prominent names of writers, directors, and stars that will be featured in the service. As of March 2019, five of the upcoming series had already completed production, with six more already well into filming.[68]On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one non-scripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series are expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode being released weekly thereafter, although Apple has stated that not all series will follow this model and that some series might instead launch all at once.[69]Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but with commentators predicting that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases would entice users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released.[70][71][11]"

        "name": "Apple Card",
        "text": "Apple Card is a credit card created by Apple Inc., but developed by Goldman Sachs, designed primarily to be used with Apple Pay on Apple devices such as an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac.[1][2] On August 6, 2019, invitations to an early preview started being sent to randomly selected users who had previously signed up for email notifications ahead of Apple Card's official launch.[3] It was released in the United States on August 20, 2019.[4] (Additional cardholders and joint accounts are not supported.)[5]Apple Card was announced at an Apple Special Event on March 25, 2019. Unlike previous special events which have historically served as platforms to announce upcoming hardware, this event focused on new internet software and services. Other services announced at the event include Apple TV+, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade.[6][7]Apple Card does not include late, cash advance, international, overdraft, or annual credit card fees, except for applicable interest charges when carrying a balance, and any interchange fees, which are charged to the vendor.[8]Users apply for Apple Card directly from within the Wallet app. If the user's application is approved, their digital Apple Card is made available for use across all of their devices instantly. Users also have the option to order a physical card for use at locations that don't accept contactless payments.As well as the digital card used to make contactless payments, users receive a 16-digit virtual card number which can be used on websites and in apps that don't accept Apple Pay. The details of this virtual card are made available in the user's iCloud Keychain so they can be auto-filled into online forms, rather than having to be typed in by hand. Notably, Apple Card's CVV is auto-filled by Safari, unlike other credit cards stored in iCloud Keychain which require manual input of their CVV number.In the event that a user suspects their virtual card number has been used on a website that has been compromised, they can generate a new virtual card number from the Wallet app, invalidating the old one.[9]The card features a cash-back reward program known as Daily Cash – the key differentiator being that cash-back is available daily, rather than at the end of each statement period.Daily Cash uses a 3–2–1 model for rewards:[10]Daily Cash is deposited into a user's Apple Cash card inside Apple Wallet, which can then be used to send money via iMessage, pay part or all of the card's balance, spend at retailers/in apps that accept Apple Pay, or be transferred to a bank account via wire transfer.[11] If the customer does not have an Apple Cash account, then Daily Cash continues to accumulate, but can only be applied as a credit toward their statement balance.[12]One of the core tenets of Apple Card is to provide users with easy-to-understand information on their spending,[10] with transactions being collated and color-coded according to category (for example food and drinks, entertainment, travel, etc.). The face of the digital card in the Wallet app changes color according to the amount spent at various categories of merchant, with the colors corresponding to each merchant's category in Apple Maps.[13]Apple Maps is also used to provide more detailed transaction information than can be shown on a traditional credit card statement – when viewing individual transactions, users are presented with a precise map location for the merchant, along with additional information such as their logo, website and contact details (where available).[13]Users can view their historical spend with weekly and monthly activity summaries, and receive intelligent recommendations on how best to pay off their balance over time in the form of payment plans, in order to avoid paying unnecessary interest.[13]A unique card number is created for each device and is stored in the device's secure element, a tamper-resistant security chip used by Apple Pay to handle transactions and on-device cryptographic functions. Each transaction uses its own one-time \"dynamic security code\", and is authorized with Face ID, Touch ID,[14] or passcode.[15]As with Apple Cash, transaction history for Apple Card is stored on—and synced across—devices using CloudKit, and encrypted such that only the authorized account holder can view it.[16] As an additional security and privacy measure, two-factor authentication must be enabled on the user's iCloud account in order to apply for Apple Card.[5][17]Apple has designed a titanium Apple Card for shopping at locations where Apple Pay contactless payment is not accepted.[10] The card has no card number, CVV security code, expiration date, or signature printed on the card.[10] The logos on the card are engraved, and the cardholder's name is printed.[citation needed]On delivery, users with the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, XS, XS Max, and XR can activate the physical card by moving their phone near a NFC tag concealed within the card's packaging.[18] Users with an iPhone X or earlier need to open the Wallet app before tapping the phone against the card.[19]The card may be permanently discolored by contact with leather or denim.[20][21]One card per householdEach individual in a household wanting to use the Apple Card must apply and each person with a card will receive a separate statement. Goldman Sachs will not issue more than one card per account.For Apple Card's initial U.S. launch, Goldman Sachs takes the role of the issuing bank,[22][2][17][23][21] with Mastercard serving as the payment network.[24]On November 7, 2019, David Heinemeier Hansson posted on Twitter a series of tweets how he was given 20 times the credit limit compared to his wife who has a better credit score. He accused Goldman Sachs of gender discrimination by using algorithms to determine a person's credit limit.[25] Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak also revealed in a tweet saying that he received 10 times the credit limit than his wife.[26] In reaction to Hansson's tweets, the New York State Department of Financial Services launched an investigation into Goldman Sachs' practices.[25]"

        "name": "iCloud",
        "text": "iCloud is a cloud storage and cloud computing service[1][2][3] from Apple Inc. launched on October 12, 2011. As of 2018, the service had an estimated 850 million users, up from 782 million users in 2016.[4][5][6]iCloud enables users to store data such as documents, photos, and music on remote servers for download to iOS, macOS or Windows devices, to share and send data to other users, and to manage their Apple devices if lost or stolen.iCloud also provides the means to wirelessly back up iOS devices directly to iCloud, instead of being reliant on manual backups to a host Mac or Windows computer using iTunes. Service users are also able to share photos, music, and games instantly by linking accounts via AirDrop wireless.iCloud replaced Apple's MobileMe service,[3] acting as a data syncing center for email, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, notes, reminders (to-do lists), iWork documents, photos, and other data.Apple has eleven company owned and operated data centers supporting iCloud services. The company has six data centers in the United States, two in Denmark, and three in Asia.[7] One of Apple's original iCloud data centers is located in Maiden, North Carolina, US.[8]Beginning in 2011, iCloud is based on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure (Apple iOS Security white paper published in 2014, Apple acknowledged that encrypted iOS files are stored in Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure[9]). In 2016, Apple signed a deal with Google to use Google Cloud Platform for some iCloud services.[10][11][12]In October 2016, Bloomberg reported that Apple was working on project Pie which aims to improve the speed and experience of Apple's online services by being operated more directly by Apple.[13] Also it was reported that Apple was going to relocate all of its services employees to the Apple Campus (1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California),[13][14] as many other employees would be moving to the Apple Park.[15]iCloud account creation requires either an iOS device running iOS 5 or later or a Mac running OS X Lion v10.7.5 or later,[16] as well as an internet connection and a compatible web browser. Also, certain features have their own minimum requirements of OS versions. For example, using iCloud Photo Sharing requires OS X Mavericks v10.9 or above on a Mac.[17]Devices running older versions of macOS (before Mavericks) or iOS (below 7) may be unable to sign into iCloud after the iCloud password has been changed: the only resolution for this issue is to upgrade the OS, which may be impossible on a device that does not meet the newer OS minimum requirements.[18]Synchronizing with a PC requires Windows 7 or later and using the iCloud Control Panel, and optionally Outlook 2007 or later or the built-in Windows 10 Mail and Calendar apps to sync Calendar, Contacts and Reminders.[19] Users must own an Apple device to set up iCloud for Windows.Synchronization of bookmarks requires Safari 5.1.1 or later on macOS, and Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 22 or Google Chrome 28 or later on Windows.[20]MobileMe account users could move their accounts to an iCloud account, keeping the same account details.[21]iCloud was announced on June 6, 2011,[22] at the 2011 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Apple announced that MobileMe would be discontinued after June 30, 2012, with anyone who had an account before the unveiling of iCloud having their MobileMe service extended to that date, free of charge.[23]The official website, www.icloud.com, went live in early August for Apple Developers. On October 12, 2011, iCloud became available to use via an iTunes update.[24] iCloud had 20 million users in less than a week after launch.[25] The iCloud.com domain and registered trademark were bought from a Swedish company called Xcerion, who rebranded their service to CloudMe.[26][27][28] Apple now controls major domains like iCloud.de, iCloud.fr and iCloud.es.[29]A class action lawsuit by customers unhappy over the transition from MobileMe to iCloud was filed in early-May 2012.[30]In June 2019, iCloud was introduced to Windows 10 via the Microsoft Store.[31]The first official mention of iCloud from Apple came on May 31, 2011, when a press release[32] announced that it would demonstrate the service at the WWDC on June 6, 2011. A banner hung at the Moscone Center for WWDC revealed the iCloud logo five days before the official launch.[33]At the WWDC 2011 keynote speech, Steve Jobs (in one of his last public appearances) announced iCloud will replace MobileMe services and that the basic iCloud service will be free of charge.[34]The cloud-based system allows users to store heterogenous music, photos, applications, documents, bookmarks, reminders, backups, notes, iBooks, and contacts, and provides a platform for Apple's email servers and calendars. Third-party iOS and macOS app developers are able to implement iCloud functionality in their apps through the iCloud API.[35]iCloud allows users to back up the settings and data on iOS devices running iOS 5 or later.[36] Data backed up includes photos and videos in the Camera Roll, device settings, app data, messages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS), ringtones, and Visual Voicemails.[37] Backups occur daily when the device is locked and connected to Wi-Fi and a power source. In case of a malfunction of any Apple device, during the restoration process, iCloud offers to restore all data along with App data only if the device was synced to iCloud and backed up.Back to My Mac, also previously part of MobileMe, is now part of iCloud.[38] As before, this service allows users to log in remotely to other computers that have Back to My Mac enabled and are configured with the same Apple ID. On August 9, 2018, Apple updated a support document to note that Back to My Mac would not be part of the upcoming macOS Mojave (10.14) release.An iCloud account can include an email account, much like MobileMe, .Mac, and iTools did previously. However, unlike MobileMe and its previous iterations, the email account is an optional part of an iCloud account, in that the user can choose to use a non-iCloud email address as their iCloud Apple ID. The email account can be accessed using any standard IMAP-compatible email client, as well as via web browser at iCloud.com. Additionally, on an iOS device, iCloud email is push-enabled.Users who converted existing MobileMe accounts to iCloud accounts kept their existing \"@me.com\" email addresses; users whose accounts pre-dated MobileMe and had both me.com and mac.com email addresses kept both. As well as retaining their previous addresses, users also received the matching \"@icloud.com\" address. As there is only one mailbox per account, all messages sent to any of a user's iCloud email addresses end up in the same inbox.Find My Friends was added to iCloud alongside the launch of iOS 5, allowing users to share their current location with their friends or family. iOS 6 added location-based alerts to notify the user when a device arrives at a certain location.[39]On iOS 9 and 10, Find My Friends is built into iOS and cannot be removed. From iOS 11 onwards it is included, but can be deleted and then subsequently reinstalled from the iOS App Store.In October 2015, Find My Friends was added to iCloud.com to view other \"friends\" locations.[40]Find My iPhone, formerly part of MobileMe, allows users to track the location of their iOS device or Mac. A user can see the device's approximate location on a map (along with a circle showing the radius depicting the margin of error), display a message and/or play a sound on the device (even if it is set to silent), change the password on the device, and remotely erase its contents.[41] The feature was first announced on June 10, 2009 and was included in iOS 3.0 software update as a feature for paying MobileMe users.[42] Find My iPhone was made free of charge with the iOS 4.2.1 software update on November 22, 2010, but only for devices introduced in 2010.[43] An iOS app was also released by Apple on June 18, 2010, which allows users to locate their device from other iOS devices running iOS 4 or later software.[44] In iOS 5, Find My iPhone was continued as a feature for iCloud. iOS 6 introduced Lost Mode, a new feature that allows the user to mark a device as \"lost\", making it easier to protect and find. The feature also allows someone that finds the user's lost iPhone to call the user directly without unlocking it. Similar phone finder services under various names are available for other families of smartphones.Activation Lock was introduced in 2013 with iOS 7. It is integrated with iCloud and Find My iPhone feature. This new feature locks the activation of any iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Apple watch which has been restored in either DFU or Recovery mode without first disabling the Find My iPhone feature. Once restore is completed, the device will ask for the Apple ID and password that has been previously associated with it, in order to proceed with activation, ultimately preventing any stolen device from being usable.[45][46]As of iOS 9, Find my iPhone is a built-in app, and thus cannot be removed.[47]iTunes Match debuted on November 14, 2011. It was initially available to US users only.[48] For an annual fee, customers can scan and match tracks in their iTunes music library, including tracks copied from CDs or other sources, with tracks in the iTunes Store, so customers do not have to repurchase said tracks. Customers may download up to 100,000 tracks in 256 kbit/s DRM-free AAC file format that match tracks in any supported audio file formats in customers' iTunes libraries, including ALAC and MP3. Customers also have the choice to keep their original copies stored on their computers or have them replaced by copies from the iTunes Store.[49] Any music not available in the iTunes Store is uploaded for download onto customers' other supported devices and computers; doing this will not take storage from the customers' iCloud's storage allowance. Any such tracks stored in the higher quality lossless audio ALAC, or original uncompressed PCM formats, WAV and AIFF, are transcoded to 256 kbit/s DRM-free AAC format before uploading to the customers' iCloud storage account, leaving the original higher quality local files in their original format.[50]If a user stops paying for the iTunes Match service, all copies of the DRM-free AAC iTunes Store versions of tracks that have already been downloaded onto any device can be kept,[51][52] whether on iOS devices or computers.[51]From iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks, the iTunes Radio function will be available across devices, including integration with the Music app, both on portable iOS devices and Apple TV (2nd generation onwards), as well as inside the iTunes app on Macintosh and Windows computers. It will be included in an ad-free version for subscribers to the iTunes Match service and is currently[when?] available only in the US and Australia[53]The streaming Genius shuffle is not available in current[when?] versions of iOS but is available in iTunes on the Mac.On January 28, 2016, ad-free iTunes Radio was discontinued and is therefore no longer part of iTunes Match.As of March 26, 2014, iTunes Match is available in 116 countries, while iTunes in the Cloud is available in 155 countries.[54]During the 2013 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote speech, iWork for iCloud was announced for release at the same time as the next version of the app versions of iWork later in the year. The three apps for both iOS and macOS that form Apple's iWork suite (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote), will be made available on a web interface (named as Pages for iCloud, Numbers for iCloud, and Keynote for iCloud respectively), and accessed via the iCloud website under each users iCloud Apple ID login. They will also sync with the users iOS and macOS versions of the app, should they have them, again via their iCloud Apple ID.This allows the user to edit and create documents on the web, using one of the supported browsers; currently[when?] Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. It also means that Microsoft Windows users now have access to these native –previously only Apple device– document editing tools, via the web interface.Photo Stream is a service supplied with the basic iCloud service which allows users to store the most recent 1,000 photos on the iCloud servers up to 30 days free of charge. When a photo is taken on a device with Photo Stream enabled, it is automatically uploaded to the iCloud servers; from there, it is automatically pushed to the rest of the user's registered devices. Photos in Photo Stream will automatically be removed from other devices after the user reaches the 1,000-photo or 30-day limit. Users who utilize Photo Stream on their Mac or PC can choose to have all photos permanently saved on their computer — their photos in Photo Stream will not be removed from the computer when they are dropped out of Photo Stream after the user reaches the 1,000-photo or 30-day limit. The service is also integrated with Apple TV, allowing users to view their recent photos wirelessly on their HDTV.[55]iCloud Photos is a feature on iOS 8.1 or later and OS X Yosemite (version 10.10) of later, plus web app access. The service stores all of the user's photos, maintaining their original resolution and metadata. Users can access their iCloud Photos on supported devices via the new Photos app when available or via the iCloud Photos web app at iCloud.com, which helps limit the amount of local storage each device needs to use in order to store photos (particularly those with smaller storage capacities) by storing lower-resolution versions on the device, with the user having the option to keep some/all stored locally at higher resolution.Since introduction in 2011, each account has 5 GB of free storage for owners of either an iOS device using iOS 5.x or later, or a Mac using OS X Lion 10.7 or later. Users can purchase additional storage for a total of 50 GB, 200GB or 2TB. The amount of storage is shared across all devices per iCloud Apple ID.[56]Several native features of iCloud use each user's iCloud storage allowance, specifically, Backup and restore, and email, Contacts, and Calendars. On Macs, users can also store most filetypes into iCloud folders of their choosing, rather than only storing them locally on the machine. While Photo Stream uses the iCloud servers, usage does not come out of the user's iCloud storage allowance. This is also true for iTunes Match music content, even for music that is not sold in the iTunes Store and which gets uploaded into iCloud storage, it does not count against the user's allowance. Other apps can optionally integrate app storage out of the user's iCloud storage allowance.Not all of a user's content counts as part of their iCloud storage allowance. Apple is able to keep a permanent track of every purchase a user makes under their Apple ID account, and by associating each piece of content with the user, means only one copy of every Store item is needed to be kept on Apple's servers. For items bought from the iTunes Store (music, music videos, movies, TV shows), iBooks Store (books), or App Store (iOS apps), this uses a service Apple call iTunes in the Cloud, allowing the user to automatically, or manually if preferred, re-download any of their previous purchases on to a Mac, PC, or iOS device.[54] Downloaded (or streamed, provided the user is connected to the Internet) iTunes Store content can be used across all these devices, however while iBooks Store and App Store content can be downloaded to Macs and PCs for syncing to iOS devices, only iOS and Mac devices — and their respective apps — can be used to read the books.[57] Similarly, macOS apps purchased from the Mac App Store are also linked to the Apple ID they were purchased through, and are able to be downloaded to any Mac using the same Apple ID. Also, when a user registers any new device, all previously bought Store content can be downloaded from the Store servers, or non-Store content from the iCloud servers.[58]iCloud Drive is iCloud's file hosting service for devices running iOS 8, OS X Yosemite (version 10.10), or Windows 7 or later, plus online web app access via iCloud.com. This feature allows users to store any kind of file, including photos, videos, documents, music, and other apps' data, in iCloud Drive and access it on any Mac, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, or Windows PC. Users can start their work on one device and continue on another device.[59] By default, users will still get 5 GB of storage for free as previously, but the expandable storage plans available have increased considerably in size (up to 2 TB of space) and altered to monthly subscription options from the yearly ones offered under the previous non-iCloud Drive service.In iOS 11, iCloud Drive has been integrated into the new Files app, replacing the standalone iCloud Drive app.[60][61]Messages on iCloud is a feature on iOS 11.4 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 which keeps all of a user's iMessages and SMS texts stored in the cloud. Messages are synced across Macs, iPhones and iPads.iCloud has been criticized by third-party developers for bugs that make some features nearly unusable under earlier versions of iOS and macOS, specifically the use of Core Data in iCloud, for storing and syncing larger amounts of data between third party apps on users' devices.[62][63][64]Third-party developers have reported that the changes implemented in the release of iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) address these iCloud criticisms.[65][66]iCloud Communications, a telecommunications company in Arizona, sued Apple in June 2011 for trademark infringement shortly after Apple announced iCloud.[67][68] The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court of Arizona and demanded that Apple stop using the iCloud name and pay unspecified monetary damages. iCloud Communications changed its name to Clear Digital Communications in August 2011 and dropped its lawsuit against Apple shortly thereafter.[69]Apple's iCloud service, including iCloud Drive and iOS device backups, does not provide end-to-end encryption, also known as client-side encryption,[70][71][72] and without end-to-end encryption, users' information is left unsecured because it remains easily accessible to unauthorized persons.[72][73][74][75][76]In August 2014, it was rumored that hackers had discovered an exploit involving the Find My iPhone service, which potentially allowed an attacker to brute-force a user's Apple ID and access their iCloud data. The exploit was later incorrectly rumored to have been used as part of an August 2014 leak of a large number of private, nude photos of celebrities that had been synced to their iCloud storage from their iPhone. Apple confirmed that it was working with law enforcement agencies to investigate the leak.[77][78][79] Apple subsequently denied that the iCloud service itself or the alleged exploit was responsible for the leak, asserting that the leaks were the result of a very targeted phishing attack against the celebrities.[80] On September 13, 2014 Tim Cook, while being interviewed by Charlie Rose, stated on camera that the celebrity leaks were not an iCloud exploit at all, but rather the celebrities had been phished by very targeted phishing to trick them out of their login credentials.[81]In February 2018, Apple announced that iCloud users in China would have their data, including encryption data, on servers located in the country to comply with local regulations. This raised concerns from human rights activists who claim that it may be used to track dissidents.[82] In response, CEO Tim Cook stated that Apple encrypts \"the same in every country in the world\".[83]"
